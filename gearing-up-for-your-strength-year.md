* Download your natal chart
* Find your astrological houses associated with Strength
* Create a motto for 2024 (see *The Lion’s Remedy Ritual*)
* Enlist some mineral and plant allies (ethical sources only)
* Choose your Card of the Year
* Pick a practice for embracing embodiment
* Exorcise one of Strength’s demons (ableism, gender essentialism, etc.)
* Form an affinity group for collective action
