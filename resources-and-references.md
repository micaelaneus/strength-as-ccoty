# RESOURCES & REFERENCES

One more time– join us at www.touchwoodtarot.com

We begin publishing seasonal guides in March with Aries, the astrological new year. These guides include new journal prompts, altar inspo, and rituals for Strength in each astrological season. Paid subscribers receive guidance on working with their Card of the Year in conjunction with Strength.

## TAROT & ASTROLOGY REFERENCES

We'll share more tarot and astrological references in the newsletter because we have too many to list here. To get you started, we recommend:

* *Astrology for Real Life* by Theresa Reed
* *The Holistic Tarot* by Benebell Wen

## ETHICAL SOURCES FOR RITUAL ELEMENTS

The best way to ensure your witchy supplies are ethically sourced is to ask your supplier how and where they got them. Generally, prefer local shops and direct providers in the lineage associated with that material. (For instance, buy tobacco or white sage from indigenously-owned outlets.) Think about shipping, too. A package that has to cross an ocean costs more carbon than one coming from across the state. Avoid candles made from synthetic (petroleum-based) paraffin whenever possible.

## NATAL CHARTS

Many methods for calculating your charts exist; we recommend using Whole Sign Houses. You need to know the city and the exact time of your birth.
