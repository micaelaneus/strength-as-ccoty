# PART II: Ritual

Culture is ritual: what we do, when and how we do it, and the stories we use to explain our motivation. We may practice in order to renew our dedication to our most enlightened ideals or to sanctify the nitty-gritty work of living. All reasons are good reasons.

Ritual practice is a rich subject that cannot get the treatment it deserves in this short guide. For now, we want to share three critical concepts with you here as a prelude to a deeper discussion in another forum, and then give you a basic form for structuring sacred space.

## PRINCIPLES

### PROTECT SACRED TIME

Ritual reclaims time from the mundane world to spend in utterly unproductive, wildly fulfilling ways: to clarify our individual and collective intuition, celebrate all sorts of cycles, and dream. Get off the technocratic treadmill! Move at a more organic pace set by the capacities and desires of the participants in that season or ecological context. Plan rituals into your schedule as non-negotiable appointments. Do small and short rituals that last for three snaps of your fingers. Do practices that take so long, ivy grows over them and they disappear among the tree roots. Steal back your life, as the anarchist saying goes, one sacred second at a time.

### BRING YOUR BODY

So much of the psycho-spiritual damage done by capitalism begins with the denunciation of the body. (A good amount of the outright violence starts this way, too.) Ritual gives us a chance to reenchant and re-embody ourselves with deliberate neurological retraining.

Select and use ritual elements to link energetic or intuitive experiences with the sensations of your body: sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell. Rhythm has profound impacts on perception whether communicated through visual, auditory, or tactile channels, play with it. Join magic with movement through gesture, dance, or somatic exercises like tapping. With repetition, these elements create reliable triggers to transition into the heightened awareness and sustained focus that witchcraft requires. Also, it's super fun.

Pay attention to your internal state, such as how hungry or tired you felt at the start of the ritual, both before and after your practice. Watch for changes; with experimentation, you may find ceremonial methods to balance your mood or improve your sleep.

### BEWARE BAD VIBES

No, not the kind found in Ouija boards. Protect the sacred from becoming a social media performance, or a retail therapy trend. Choose only ethically sourced herbs and stones, work within your cultural tradition, and shop locally. Don’t taint your magic with settler-colonial ick, especially in a year ruled by an amplifying archetype like Strength. When in doubt, leave it out… of your online shopping cart.

As witches, we must practice again and again to sustain and renew our craft-- we will never be "done" with ritual, so don't let us catch you treating it like an item on your to-do list! Ritual is our reward for doing Hard Things in our lives and out in the world, so savor it.

## SHAPING SACRED SPACE

### INVOCATION

* Who, what, when, why
* Examples:
  * "On this full moon in Taurus, we gather together to consecrate a collective grimoire."
  * "I come to this park where I played as a child to summon a lover who wants to start a family with me, empowered by Ostara's energy."
  * "We signed the divorce papers this morning. May my ritual this afternoon cleanse this apartment of any stagnant energy that may block my healing."

* settle into your body

Mark the transition into the ritual space by lighting a candle, invoking stone and plant allies, burning incense, or doing other ritual strategies. These elements help create a boundary between the ordinary and the sacred, setting this work apart from other day-to-day activities. You do not need any of them, however. Deep breaths and strong intentions work magic all by themselves.

* invoke allies

An optional step is to call in any guides, ancestors, or other helpers. Invite them by name and tell them why you seek their presence. Since we are working with Strength this year, you might call in people who embody its themes. Example: “Grandma Jo, you dared to leave your husband despite society’s pressure to stay. Share your courage with me today.”

If you have a method for casting a circle, calling the corners, etc. in your practice, perform it here.

Announce your reason for performing the ritual and dedicate the merits:
*“I gather here to* [your purpose or a general desire], *and I dedicate any merits of my work to the highest good of all beings* [or name a recipient].”

When your reflection feels complete, close your circle according to your practice or simply say something like:

“May all helpers gathered here go in peace with my gratitude, and may the work done here be for the good of all. So concludes my ritual.”

Celebrate and sustain yourself with rituals, great and small, and you will never get lost in the maze of modern life. As ye harm none, do as ye will!

## RITUAL ELEMENTS & STRATEGIES

We use ritual elements to physicalize the ethereal experiences of our practice. They root the ephemeral into tangible objects and gestures that we can trust to help us return to those states or summon those energies. Because they aid our work, we often call these elements our allies. Use this section to inspire a spiritual scavenger hunt for allies that connect you to the Strength archetype, or to any theme you wish to explore in ceremony.

### MINERAL & PLANT ALLIES

Fresh or dried roses and rosewater; edible herbs associated with protection magic such as sage, bay leaf, and rosemary; frankincense above all other incenses but also smudging plants like mugwort or cedar that have fortifying uses (as opposed to healing or cleansing herbs like sage and palo santo); essential oils containing these herbs.

Hardy plants with woody stems make great additions to your altar this year: sprigs of evergreens like pine, juniper, and mistletoe. (No, it’s not just for smooching!) Stout species of brush grow in nearly every climate, so find a new local plant ally. If the element of water rules your personal Card of the Year (see Part V: Your Card of the Year) then willow, cattails, or other tough marshy plants make nice additions. To those suffering from heartaches or struggling to adapt to a sudden unwelcome change, we recommend getting a Rose of Jericho (*Selaginella lepidophylla*), also called a resurrection plant.

Exuberant, boisterous sunflowers remind us more of The Sun archetype than Strength but we defer to your wishes. The seeds make lovely altar offerings to share with neighboring birds and squirrels-- raw and unsalted ones, not BBQ-flavored!

Simple teas with acidic or citrusy flavors evoke the zesty energy and candor of Strength. Find a lemony tea to drink only while doing creative work (perhaps with ginger or other invigorating herb), to build a sense-memory into your practice. Blends that feature Schisandra berries, hibiscus, or even licorice (i.e., gentle detox herbs) complement shadow work. Richly fragrant teas dominated by rose or lavender will always make us think of Leo. You might get overly energized at times this year, so keep calming herbs like chamomile and catnip in the cupboard as well.

Stones with protective associations like tourmaline, tiger’s eye, and agate; gold-toned minerals like mica, chalcopyrite, and literal gold to activate creativity (doubly so when you hope to make money from the effort); those giant juicy-looking pieces of raw calcite for connecting with joy, our emotional superpower; hematite for breaking curses like truly destructive relationship patterns or addictions; pyrite when you struggle to walk away from a situation (job, relationship); bronzite for grace under pressure; jade for endurance or equanimity; turquoise when starting new ventures.

Stones represent Earth, which balances Fire's more manic manifestations. Consequently, you may find crystals even more useful this year, particularly water-safe varieties.

### ALTAR STRATEGIES

While you do not need an altar at home, you may very much enjoy one. Dedicate an area to ritual elements and objects that keep your mind on your magic. Tables are traditional but a corner of your desk, a bookshelf, or a windowsill works perfectly well. If you can’t devote that much space to a complex altar, get devious: a double-page collage in your journal stood upright makes a pleasant background, or try an empty tin of breath mints. All energy spent creating beauty and cultivating joy returns to you, three times three! (All energy spent impressing algorithms is wasted.)

You may find pleasure in honoring or calling in people who incarnate an aspect of the Strength archetype to you. Hero-worship is very shadow-Magician in our minds, but we love to celebrate someone who embodies an admirable aspect of humanity. Try adding their image to your altar, playing their music while you journal, or eating their favorite foods. Maybe skip smoking their favorite cigarette? Everything that serves life is fair game.

### PLACES OF POWER

You belong to the Earth and every atom sings for you. We long to worship your ineffable wonderfulness at the tops of mountains and crests of high tides. Please go someplace that puts you deeply in touch with your power as one of this planet’s most favored children and we promise to meet you there. (Or at least send a worthy representative to honor you in our stead.) May we suggest a meadow blooming after a flood, a forest regrowing after a wildfire, or a pigeon nesting in the plastic anti-pigeon spikes?

### SPELLCRAFT

This year invites us to perform rituals that increase creativity, make bold changes, and break bad habits.

Consider casting or refreshing spells and talismans you’ve put in place for *protection.* Bless doorways, cleanse your home or other significant space, dust and re-hang wards like Nazar amulets, etc. Giving your home a practical deep clean always feels good, especially when you concentrate on areas related to career and creativity. (Yes, we just told you to clean up your desk.) Add purifying allies like lemon juice or rosemary oil to your mop bucket, or spritz the rugs with rosewater after beating them. We have some witchy projects planned this year that we’ll share in the newsletter for folks, too.

We strongly associate Strength with *curse-breaking.* Think of a curse as any pattern that binds you and that you might have inherited from your family of origin or formative peers. For instance, you might use a combination of ritual, therapy, and support groups to break the classic codependent curse: marrying alcoholics. Or you might feel like someone has fixated on you in a very dark way and you need to sever the attachment with a cord-cutting ceremony. One friend of ours finally threw out his raggedy college futon over ten years after graduating and immediately got offered a full-time contract with the company of his dreams. Ditch any similarly cursed clutter in your life.

Manifesting has gotten some well-deserved critique in the last few years, and we agree with all of it. It takes more than open chakras to get what you need in this capitalist thrill factory. The idea of magical shortcuts for the pure of heart insults us all, and it degrades the principles of radical witchcraft. That said, using ritual to direct your willpower and put yourself in the right headspace to succeed has value in our eyes. For an endeavor where you acknowledge the role of privilege and have a plan to do the work, rituals to *manifest helpers or opportunities* make sense in a Strength year.
