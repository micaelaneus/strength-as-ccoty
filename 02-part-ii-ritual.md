# PART II: Ritual

Culture is ritual: what we do, when and how we do it, and the stories we use to explain our motivation. We may practice in order to renew our dedication to our most enlightened ideals or to sanctify the nitty-gritty work of living. All reasons are good reasons. Celebrate and sustain yourself with rituals, great and small, and you will never get lost in the maze of modern life. As ye harm none, do as ye will!

* short rituals are also awesome! don't make everything a big whopping deal

Celebrate and sustain yourself with rituals, great and small, and you will never get lost in the maze of modern life. As ye harm none, do as ye will!

### OPENING & CLOSING THE CIRCLE

Mark the transition into the ritual space by lighting a candle, invoking stone and plant allies, burning incense, or doing other ritual strategies. These elements help create a boundary between the ordinary and the sacred, setting this work apart from other day-to-day activities. You do not need any of them, however. Deep breaths and strong intentions work magic all by themselves. If you have a method for casting a circle, calling the corners, etc. in your practice, perform it here.

An optional step is to call in any guides, ancestors, or other helpers. Invite them by name and tell them why you seek their presence. Since we are working with Strength this year, you might call in people who embody its themes. Example: “Grandma Jo, you dared to leave your husband despite society’s pressure to stay. Share your courage with me today.”

Announce your reason for performing the ritual and dedicate the merits:
*“I gather here to* [your purpose or a general desire], *and I dedicate any merits of my work to the highest good of all beings* [or name a recipient].”

When your reflection feels complete, close your circle according to your practice or simply say something like:

“May all helpers gathered here go in peace with my gratitude, and may the work done here be for the good of all. So concludes my ritual.”

### BRING YOUR BODY

* build sense-memories
* include movement and sound

## RITUAL ELEMENTS & STRATEGIES

Now let's look at ritual elements and activities to work with Strength. Anything you love or feel called to works, these are just themes for Strength in particular. 

Beware bad vibes! Choose only ethically sourced herbs and stones, work within your cultural tradition, and shop locally. Don’t taint your magic with settler-colonial ick, especially in a year ruled by an amplifying archetype like Strength. When in doubt, leave it out… of your online shopping cart.

### MINERAL & PLANT ALLIES

Fresh or dried roses and rosewater; edible herbs associated with protection magic such as sage, bay leaf, and rosemary; frankincense above all other incenses but also smudging plants like mugwort or cedar that have fortifying uses (as opposed to healing or cleansing herbs like sage and palo santo); essential oils containing these herbs.

Hardy plants with woody stems make great additions to your altar this year: sprigs of evergreens like pine, juniper, and mistletoe. (No, it’s not just for smooching!) Stout species of brush grow in nearly every climate, so find a new local plant ally. If the element of water rules your personal Card of the Year (see Part V) then willow, cattails, or other tough marshy plants make nice additions. To those suffering from heartaches or struggling to adapt to a sudden unwelcome change, we recommend getting a Rose of Jericho (Selaginella lepidophylla), also called a resurrection plant.

Exhuberant, boisterous sunflowers remind us more of The Sun archetype than Strength but we defer to your wishes. The seeds make lovely altar offerings to share with neighboring birds and squirres-- raw and unsalted ones, not BBQ-flavored!

Simple teas with acidic or citrusy flavors evoke the zesty energy and candor of Strength. Find a lemony tea to drink only while doing creative work (perhaps with ginger or other invigorating herb), to build a sense-memory into your practice. Blends that feature Schisandra berries, hibiscus, or even licorice (i.e., gentle detox herbs) complement shadow work. Richly fragrant teas dominated by rose or lavender will always make us think of Leo. You might get overly energized at times this year, so keep calming herbs like chamomile and catnip in the cupboard as well.

Stones with protective associations like tourmaline, tiger’s eye, and agate; gold-toned minerals like mica, chalcopyrite, and literal gold to activate creativity (doubly so when you hope to make money from the effort); those giant juicy-looking pieces of raw calcite for connecting with joy, our emotional superpower; hematite for breaking curses like truly destructive relationship patterns or addictions; pyrite when you struggle to walk away from a situation (job, relationship); bronzite for grace under pressure; jade for endurance or equanimity; turquoise when starting new ventures.

Stones represent Earth, which balances Fire's more manic manifestations. Consequently, you may find crystals even more useful this year, particularly water-safe varieties.

### ALTAR STRATEGIES

While you do not need an altar at home, you may very much enjoy one. Dedicate an area to ritual elements and objects that keep your mind on your magic. Tables are traditional but a corner of your desk, a bookshelf, or a windowsill works perfectly well. If you can’t devote that much space to a complex altar, get devious: a double-page collage in your journal stood upright makes a pleasant background, or try an empty tin of breath mints. All energy spent creating beauty and cultivating joy returns to you, three times three! (All energy spent impressing algorithms is wasted.)

You may find pleasure in honoring or calling in people who incarnate an aspect of the Strength archetype to you. Hero-worship is very shadow-Magician in our minds, but we love to celebrate someone who embodies the sunny side of humanity. Try adding their image to your altar, playing their music while you journal, or eating their favorite foods. Maybe skip smoking their favorite cigarette? Everything that serves life is fair game.

### LANDSCAPES

You belong to the Earth and every atom sings for you. We long to worship your ineffable wonderfulness at the tops of mountains and crests of high tides. Please go someplace that puts you deeply in touch with your power as one of this planet’s most favored children and we promise to meet you there. (Or at least send a worthy representative to honor you in our stead.) May we suggest a meadow blooming after a flood, a forest regrowing after a wildfire, or a pigeon nesting in the plastic anti-pigeon spikes?

### SPELLCRAFT

This year invites us to perform rituals that increase creativity, make bold changes, and break bad habits.

Consider casting or refreshing spells and talismans you’ve put in place for protection. Bless doorways, cleanse your home or other significant space, dust and re-hang wards like Nazar amulets, etc. A deep clean of your home, concentrating on areas related to your career and creativity, always feels good. (Yes, we just told you to clean up your desk.) Add purifying allies like lemon juice or rosemary oil to your mop bucket, or spritz the rugs with rosewater after beating them. We have some witchy projects planned this year that we’ll share in the newsletter for folks who get stuck.

We strongly associate Strength with curse-breaking. Think of a curse as any pattern that binds you and that you might have inherited from your family of origin or formative peers. For instance, you might break a classic codependent curse like marrying alcoholics by using a combination of ritual and therapy. Or you might feel like someone has fixated on you in a very dark way and you need to sever the attachment with a cord-cutting ceremony. One friend of ours finally threw out his raggedy college futon over ten years after graduating and immediately got offered a full-time contract with the company of his dreams. Ditch any similarly cursed clutter in your life.

Manifesting has gotten some well-deserved critique in the last few years, and we agree with all of it. It takes more than open chakras to get what you need in this capitalist thrill factory. The idea of magical shortcuts for the pure of heart insults us all, and it degrades the principles of radical witchcraft. That said, using ritual to direct your willpower and put yourself in the right headspace to succeed has value in our eyes. For an endeavor where you acknowledge the role of privilege and have a plan to do the work, rituals to manifest helpers or opportunities make sense in a Strength year.

## TRANSITION 

Good idea on how to connect with the archetype, we can personalize how we work with Strength by adding astrology. Make sure you have your natal chart handy.
