The Eighth Key directs our energy toward balancing the raw power of our will with an enlightened attitude of acceptance. Strength expresses itself candidly, never dimming the flame of its desire or hiding its vulnerability, and thus approaches invincibility. This key follows The Chariot, when we learn to make our way through the world, and prepares us to pass The Hermit’s more esoteric tests.

In an open field, we see a Figure holding the mouth of a Lion with a full mane and lolling tongue. The Lion has claws yet looks subdued and its tail tucks between its legs. The Figure wears a simple white robe like those worn by initiates or romanticized peasants. Garlands of blooming flowers that might be roses wrap around their waist, and they wear a crown of meadow grasses or spring wheat. The only jewelry or ornament we see is the lemniscate that floats above the Figure’s head. In the distance, a forest lies at the base of a mountain range. The sky is cloudless.

Roman numerals for eight appear at the top-center and a box separates the card’s title, “Strength,” from the imagery. The artist, Pamela Coleman Smith, put her stylized initials at the bottom-right of her illustration.

## SYMBOLS OF THE ARCHETYPE

We cover the astrological correspondences in greater detail in Astrology. Plants, minerals, and other associations with Strength are found in Ritual Strategies. Let's start by looking at the symbols found on the tarot card itself.

### THE LION’S JAWS

The card’s central image shows a Figure grasping the open jaws of a Lion. Many say this act symbolizes taming or mastering one's instinctual nature, which implies that our basic desires are destructive. We agree that the Lion represents an element of primal energy inherent in embodiment, but one we must integrate, not tame. The relationship between the Figure and the Lion seems filled with mutual trust, affection, and even playfulness. Holding the Lion's jaws now looks like a collaboration between instinct and discernment, two key elements of an evolved mind. The jaws themselves represent that liminal edge between trust and risk that we call vulnerability.

### THE LEMNISCATE AKA INFINITY SYMBOL

This well-known icon floating above the Figure’s head connects them to the ethereal, offering a point of balance to the otherwise lusty fleshiness of this card. A lemniscate loops endlessly over and around itself, suggesting an active energy that nevertheless stays in harmony with the greater universe. Its presence here reminds us that although Strength primarily relates to our personal power, we must stay in alignment to fully realize the lessons of this key.

### THE WHITE ROBE & INWARD GAZE

White robes symbolize purity, spiritual clarity, and the alignment of one's actions with higher principles. Traditionally, we wear all white as initiates, as (don’t laugh) virginal brides, and finally as shrouds. Seeing the Figure wear this simple robe rather than armor or an aristocratic fabric like silk tells us we’re not dealing with those forms of power. This Strength enters humbly, a perpetual novice prepared for their next rite of passage. Notice that the Figure gazes calmly and directly into the Lion’s eyes, not outward into our own as in most cards in the first half of the Major Arcana. We take this to mean that Strength has the discipline to stay in their lane, keep their eyes on their own paper, and never read the comments.

### FLOWERS & WREATHS

The vibrant foliage adorning the Figure’s waist and crown exudes joy and boldly shouts huzzah for Life! In a socio-economic system built on constraints, flourishing takes Strength. Think of the audacity shown by wildflowers growing along a highway median, pushing up through the asphalt designed to destroy them. Or picture the vivid genitalia-like splendor of the orchid. No shame, baby. Do you have the courage of a dandelion?
