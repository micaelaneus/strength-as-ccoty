# INTERPRETATION

First and foremost, the Strength card encourages us to draw on courage and compassion to navigate challenges with conviction. This card encourages us to confront our fears, embrace challenges, and cultivate resilience on the journey toward self-discovery. As our Collective Card of the Year, it promises a period of tremendous growth and expansive possibilities that flourish even amidst obstacles. The roses winding around the Figure’s waist and crown have thorns, no doubt– yet nothing stops their blooming.

In short, this card says *you can do it!* Mercifully, it also provides hints on how.

Look first at the peaceful expression on The Figure’s face. It tells us that the kind of robust resilience we seek does not come through domination and control. Instead, we find strength through self-acceptance and equanimity. Celebrating our power helps us overcome our fears, a major theme of this card. We develop a healthy sense of ego by first meeting life’s challenges and then taking a moment to appreciate our newfound abilities. Reflect on a time you’ve been a bit bolder than you thought possible. Luxuriate in the feeling, regardless of the outcome. Savor yourself with the same shameless delight of a cat licking itself.

An aura of gentleness, even playfulness, surrounds the pair shown on the card. The Figure and the Lion look relaxed because they both feel safely held within a relationship built on mutual respect. Where an archetype like The Magician marshals tools and declares their will, Strength gets things done through exercising soft power: deep listening, skillful negotiation, and reciprocity. These skills only seem like magic. In truth, they are strategies we can learn to make facing and resolving disagreements more manageable. Find good teachers.
On a related note, this card might indicate that a relationship has undergone a rupture that now requires repairing. Strength says that we can make amends without denying the original harm or letting it continue unchecked. Revisit harms done to you or by you with fresh eyes and look for opportunities to restore balance. You may never get to hear the apology you deserve or make one that you long to deliver, and yet you must find a way to move forward.

Not that it’s going to be the walk in the park, never mind the meadow shown on the card. To take responsibility for how our most damaging impulses and fears show up in every aspect of our lives, we must first acknowledge their existence. Yikes! Accountability always takes moral courage and owning our vulnerabilities in a society built on exploitation requires real guts. Holding others accountable is equally tough, especially when we love them or when the behavior stems from addiction or mental health issues. Whichever side of the proverbial street you stand on, clean it up.

Self-expression is tricky in a world built on oppression. We suppress aspects of ourselves because we learned, correctly or not, that expressing them leads to pain and danger. Strength asks us to reclaim the energy spent on repression to conquer shame and find communities where we shine most brilliantly. Where does authenticity feel sticky to you? Resist the urge to start yet another self-improvement project or rush to solve this problem via external means. Allow yourself to feel the spaciousness and grace that come by frankly acknowledging the truth.

Finally, notice that the Figure approaches the Lion fearlessly. Their relationship has a caring vibe. The Strength card reminds us that we all have an expressive power within us that exists beyond the reach of shame or self-deception. Strength in this light looks like someone who has faced their fears with compassion and found a deep well of self-acceptance to draw from as they face the world.

## SHADOW ASPECTS

Or does the Figure grip the Lion’s jaws as a show of superiority and domination? 

In the real world, people “train” large cats by controlling access to food, mixing affection with intimidation, and inflicting pain. Violence and head games induce a condition of learned helplessness that entrenches the abuse into the cats’ psyches. Honestly, we cheer a little when we hear about one of these cats mauling their captor-trainers.

We see this dangerous fixation on control in Strength's shadow. Asserting dominance may feel amazing at the moment, but the lack of empathy ultimately limits growth for all parties involved. We can use this card to examine several ways ]this pattern plays out in our relationships.

First, a desire to demonstrate strength might lead to a mindset of overcoming challenges at any cost. A deadly dog-eat-dog worldview allows us to justify all manner of (self-) destructive behaviors. Next thing you know, this flowery Figure morphs into a latte-guzzling, over-scheduled girlboss who scares the crap out of poor Lion. (Look at the tail between its legs!) This attitude could result in neglecting your well-being or that of others to pursue external validation. Consider how ideologies like scarcity thinking, hustle culture, or hyper-individualism negatively influence the matter at hand.

Alternatively, we might put on a facade of strength to appear composed and resilient on the outside while struggling internally. This emotional armor causes difficulty in seeking support when needed and may manifest as toxic positivity. This card tells us that not only do we need help, we deserve it. Perhaps you must give or receive a form of support that makes you somehow uncomfortable.

We often confuse self-criticism with self-discipline. Beating yourself up works at times or else we wouldn’t do it, right? But the costs to our self-esteem and peace of mind can be staggering. Strength suggests that it’s time for a new strategy. Try incorporating self-compassion into your approach to a challenge and trust that self-discipline can emerge from self-acceptance.

Love never seeks to control. All forms of domination or deception crush the spirit of awe and reverence that love requires. Yet the fear of losing love can make us feel the need to exert control in subtle ways. For example, we might hide parts of ourselves or start fibbing to manipulate how we’re perceived. If we suspect our partners have begun to grow away from us, we pressure them in similar ways. Some relationships go on like this for decades-- will yours?

Perhaps you notice another theme uniting Strength’s shadows: the capacity to endure what ought not to be endured. On an individual level, we experience this shadow when we choose to suppress our feelings rather than deal with conflict openly. Misalignment causes profound distress and still, we’d rather suffer than deal with the discomfort of acknowledging the issue. We gaslight ourselves, do extra physical or affective labor, or make excuses for a toxic person– anything and everything to protect ourselves from having to make hard choices based on facts. Eventually, the situation explodes, fizzles out, or becomes our new normal. If you’re caught in this trap, Strength’s appearance means you need to get real about the situation before you're forced to gnaw off a leg.

On a collective level, these shadows manifest as political inertia. We vote for “the lesser of two evils” rather than organize ourselves to build a more just and beautiful world. We spin our wheels on social media rather than show up in real life, or do any number of other behaviors that disconnect us from our collective power. Problems with accountability, consent, and cultural appropriation fall into this same category.

In its darkest, most hateful manifestation, this card signifies fascism. The word fascism comes from the Italian fascia, meaning a bundle of sticks bound together. The image represents the idea of strength in numbers: a bundle can resist a force that would break a solitary stick. It could have been a beautiful metaphor but jabronies took it all the way to crap town. Resisting the global reemergence of fascism is perhaps the most critical collective action we will take this year. 

## IN READINGS

Tarot practitioners commonly read the Strength card as an amplifier. Its presence emphasizes the influence of that placement and possibly the surrounding cards. When drawn as the signifier (often the first card of a spread) it suggests that the focus of the reading has profound meaning or potential power for the subject.

Watch too for the appearance of Wands, particularly the Queen of Wands. A fiery spread might indicate an extra charge (i.e., higher intensity or greater urgency) to the focus of the reading, especially one on creativity.

Previous incarnations of the Tarot called this card “Force.” That word carries a more concentrated energy, implying a strong and tightly directed use of willpower. See if that interpretation fits better in that placement.

Lastly, this sunny archetype moonlights as a curse-breaker. Destructive interpersonal dynamics, ruts that feel impossible to escape, and compulsive behaviors of all sorts can be changed when Strength appears in a relevant placement.
