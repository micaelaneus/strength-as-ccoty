# TAROT: The Mutual Aid Spread

As you get to know them, the archetypes of the Major Arcana start to feel like a group of long-time friends. Some get on like gangbusters, some obviously slept together, and a few inevitably bicker. Use this spread to check on how well your COTY vibes with Strength, and where you might need to mediate. One more thing: we show the cards in an x-shape to signify the energies *intersect*, not necessarily *cross* as in the common +-shaped overlap.

## READING THE MUTUAL AID SPREAD

Ground yourself by taking deep breaths, opening a ritual space, or centering with another method in your practice.

Pull two cards to establish how Strength (Card 1) and your COTY (Card 2) see you, presently. 

The next pair reveals existing energy or expertise related to the themes of Strength (Card 3) and your COTY (Card 4) that you bring to the situation. This pairing hints at how you might get these archetypes to team up to help you in times ahead. 

The second set shows contradicting desires, characteristics, or patterns of Strength (Card 6) and COTY (Card 7). They may clash or confuse one another. These placements reveal prospective tensions. 

The final pair points to one of Strength’s themes that either balances or encourages an aspect of your COTY (Card 7) and a COTY card theme that does the same for Strength (Card 8). In other words, how they bring out the best in one another.

Pause. Shift your perspective so that rather than eight individual cards, you see the spread as one unified image conveying a single message. A query might bubble up inside you. Hold either the spread’s message or this fresh query in mind as you pull a final card to reveal a message co-authored by your allies for the year (Card 9).
