## How to Use This Guide
### Gather your supplies
#### GET A JOURNAL
This guide is optimized for printing in whole or part based on your needs and desires, using only black-and-white ink, narrow margins, and meaningful page breaks. With a minimalist design, you won’t find much space to take notes within the guide itself. Secondly, we have laid out the structure for a very active practice involving self-reflection, somatic exercise, and real-world challenges. You’re gonna need a journal to keep up!

#### SELECT A TAROT DECK
This guide uses the classic deck illustrated by Pamela Coleman Smith that comes with the “little white book” of interpretations written by Arthur Edward Waite and originally published in 1909 by Rider & Son of London. You will hear it called by some combination of those three names: the Rider-Waite, the Waite-Smith, or even the Rider-Waite-Coleman-Smith deck are all common variants. We refer to it as the RWCS to cover all these cases and whatever you choose to call it, it is the most recognizable version of the Tarot. 

While we believe you’ll get the most from this guide if you have a standard WCS deck to explore, we support your choice to choose another deck from this lineage. Many modern tarot artists have adapted the ideas and storylines of the RWCS deck and we list some of our favorites in Resources and References. You can always refer to the Wikipedia entry for the deck to see an image of each card in its original design. 

Note that we use the Strength-Justice ordering to interpret The Fool’s Journey, which might alter the meaning for decks with the less common Justice-Strength ordering. 
#### CREATE AN ALTAR SPACE
Get creative: a corner of your desk, a double-page spread of your journal, a spot on your nightstand, etc. We offer more specific ideas about altar items to evoke elements of Strength in the Ritual Strategies section of this guide; generally, you might expect to use candles, a container for water, incense, herbs or flowers, stones or crystals, and other small objects.
### Join the Community
Get new journal prompts, altar inspo, and rituals at the beginning of each astrological season. The free edition focuses on working with the Strength card. Paid subscribers receive guidance on working with their Card of the Year in conjunction with Strength. LINK
### Do the Work
You don’t need to start in January. The astrological year begins in the Aries Season (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19) and the majority of our work as Touchwood Tarot kicks off then. 

Do make time to practice the rituals.
