# Strength

## Tarot, astrology, and ritual for our collective card of the year in 2024

## HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

Welcome to our Strength year! We made this guide to serve your growth and well-being, as well as support your involvement in collective struggle. Inside, you’ll find X spreads that combine mythopoetic tarot with astrology. We’ve given you several themes you might want to explore in your ritual and spell work alongside one full ritual to transition from a year of The Chariot (2023) into the incoming Strength year. We share some ideas on how to extend this collective work by incorporating your individual Card of the Year (COTY) and working in the open circle (more on that below).

You need only two essential tools to use this guide: a journal and a tarot deck.

This guide uses the classic deck illustrated by Pamela Coleman Smith that comes with the “little white book” of interpretations written by Arthur Edward Waite, originally published in 1909 by Rider & Son of London. You will hear it called by some combination of those three names: the Rider-Waite, the Waite-Smith, or even the Rider-Waite-Coleman-Smith deck are all common variants. We refer to it as the RWCS deck to cover all these cases. Whatever you call it, it is the most recognizable version of the tarot.

Many modern tarot artists have adapted the ideas and storylines of the RWCS deck to suit (sorry) their needs, and we list a selection in *Resources and References.* The Wikipedia entry for the deck has an image of each card as designed in 1909 for folks who don’t own one yet.

## WORK WITH US THROUGHOUT THE YEAR

We begin publishing seasonal guides for working with Strength as our collective card of the year in March when Aries kicks off the new astrological year. Each guide offers tarot, astrology, and ritual inspiration in keeping with that season’s astrological sign. Our work belongs to the emerging discipline of radical witchcraft, though you might hear other names for the mix of paganism and anti-authoritarian politics we practice.

## A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO READING TAROT

It takes about three minutes to master the basics of reading the cards: form a question in your mind, pull a card, and look up the meaning in a book or on a website. Of course, you’ll get more from tarot by taking each of those steps seriously.  Let’s go through them.

First, you don’t need a tricked-out altar to read tarot. We adore the aesthetics as much as the next witch, but the magic comes from centering yourself. If incense and candles get you there, go for it! But never believe that your intuitive practices require them.

Whether or not you use a pre-defined spread, you need a well-articulated theme or query related to developing your potential and directing your power. Frame your query like you’re asking advice from a trusted friend, not a favor from a rich one. Only one witch got to the ball in a pumpkin that we know of; the rest of us have to hoof it.

A useful question sticks to a timeframe where you have the power to act, meaning either the present or near future in most cases. Asking “Will I be a famous author?” before you so much as sharpen a pencil won’t yield useful information. Too much work lies between you and the goal. Try, “What can I put energy into that would help me improve as a writer?”

Interpreting the cards skillfully takes blending the vast array of traditional meanings with your intuition at the moment you pull a card. Everyone refers to the writing of other tarot practitioners, even “experts” because we all find inspiration in the diversity of thought. Never apologize for looking up a card! Yet we also urge you to trust your intuition. Pay attention to your immediate impression and associations, jot them down in your journal, and then see what others have to say.

You will inevitably pull cards with disturbing imagery and intimidating descriptions that many folks call “hard cards.” We firmly believe (and have personally experienced) that every card offers wise counsel in its own way. Think of cards that upset you as bitter medicine: truths that hurt to swallow yet still may heal you. Also remember that a strong reading draws our attention to the path we’re walking, but it doesn’t control our steps. A card or spread that bothers you means that it’s time to find a fork in the road, not lay down in the middle of it.

Lastly, don’t try to use tarot to read minds– it’s not healthy, and it won’t work anyway.

## WORKING IN THE OPEN CIRCLE

If you’ve opened a circle with others, then you have likely encountered a version of a classic closing phrase: *the circle is open yet unbroken.* It means that although our time in a ritual space necessarily ends and we return to “normal life”, we remain connected in a larger universal circle that encompasses all beings. How we act toward and speak to one another and our moral obligations to the more-than-human world stay within this sacred open-yet-unbroken circle.

We use the name Open Circle Work to describe:

* all forms of political organizing
* going to therapy or support groups
* unionizing and whistle-blowing
* unlearning oppressive behaviors like white supremacy
* land remediation
* exploring gender and sexuality
* all the other “radical” parts of radical witchcraft, basically

It’s a fun list! We consider the open circle a non-negotiable aspect of our magic and you’ll see that phrase throughout this guide.

## PART I: STRENGTH IN THE TAROT

The Eighth Key directs our energy toward balancing the raw power of our will with an enlightened attitude of acceptance. Strength expresses itself candidly, never dimming the flame of its desire or hiding its vulnerability, and thus approaches invincibility. This key follows The Chariot, when we learn to make our way through the world, and prepares us to pass The Hermit’s more esoteric tests.

### LOOKING AT THE CARD

In an open field, we see a Figure holding the mouth of a Lion with a full mane and open mouth. The Lion has claws yet looks subdued and its tail tucks between its legs. The Figure wears a simple white robe like those worn by initiates or romanticized peasants. Garlands of blooming flowers that might be roses wrap around their waist, and they wear a crown of meadow grasses or spring wheat. The only jewelry or ornament we see is the lemniscate that floats above the Figure’s head. In the distance, a forest lies at the base of a mountain range. The sky is cloudless.

Roman numerals for eight appear at the top-center and a box separates the card’s title, “Strength,” from the imagery. The artist, Pamela Coleman Smith, put her stylized initials at the bottom-right of her illustration.

### SYMBOLS & CORRESPONDENCES

#### ASTROLOGY & ALLIES

We cover the astrological correspondences in greater detail in *Astrology*. Plants, minerals, and other associations with Strength are found in *Ritual Strategies.*

#### THE LION’S JAWS

The card’s central image shows a Figure grasping the open jaws of a lion. Many say this act symbolizes taming or mastering one's instinctual nature, which strongly implies that our basic desires are destructive. We agree that the lion represents an element of primal energy inherent in embodiment. Its relationship with the Figure, however, seems filled with mutual trust, affection, and even playfulness. Holding the lion’s jaws now seems like an act of collaboration between the unruly truths of existence and a mind with the Strength to engage them gracefully. The jaws themselves represent that liminal edge between trust and risk that we call *vulnerability.*

#### THE LEMNISCATE AKA INFINITY SYMBOL

This well-known icon floating above the Figure’s head connects them to the ethereal, offering a point of balance to the otherwise lusty fleshiness of this card. A lemniscate loops endlessly over and around itself, suggesting an active energy that nevertheless stays in harmony with the greater universe. Its presence here reminds us that although Strength primarily relates to our personal power, we must stay in alignment to fully realize the lessons of this key.

#### THE WHITE ROBE & INWARD GAZE

White robes symbolize purity, spiritual clarity, and the alignment of one's actions with higher principles. Traditionally, we wear all white as initiates, as (don’t laugh) virginal brides, and finally as shrouds. Seeing the Figure wear this simple robe rather than armor or an aristocratic fabric like silk tells us we’re not dealing with those forms of power. This Strength enters humbly, a perpetual novice not afraid of their next rite of passage. Notice that the Figure gazes calmly and directly into the lion’s eyes, not outward into our own as in most cards in the first half of the Major Arcana. We take this to mean that Strength has the discipline to stay in their lane, keep their eyes on their own paper, and never read the comments.

#### FLOWERS & WREATHS

The vibrant foliage adorning the Figure’s waist and crown exudes joy and boldly shouts huzzah for Life! In a socio-economic system built on constraints, flourishing takes Strength. Think of the audacity shown by wildflowers growing along a highway median, pushing up through the asphalt designed to destroy them. Or picture the vivid genitalia-like splendor of the orchid. No shame, baby. Do you have the courage of a dandelion?

### INTERPRETATION

First and foremost, the Strength card encourages us to draw on courage and compassion to navigate challenges with forceful conviction. This card encourages us to confront our fears, embrace challenges, and cultivate resilience on the journey toward self-discovery. As our Collective Card of the Year, it promises a period of tremendous growth and expansive possibilities that flourish even amidst obstacles. The roses winding around the Figure’s waist and crown have thorns, no doubt– yet nothing stops their blooming.

In short, this card says *you can do it!* Mercifully, it also gives us some hints on how.

Look first at the peaceful expression on The Figure’s face. It tells us that the kind of robust resilience we seek does not come through domination and control. Instead, we find strength through self-acceptance and equanimity. Celebrating our power helps us overcome our fears, a major theme of this card. We develop a healthy sense of ego by first meeting life’s challenges and then taking a moment to appreciate our newfound abilities. Reflect on a time you’ve been a bit bolder than you thought possible. Luxuriate in the feeling, regardless of the outcome. Savor yourself with the same shameless delight of a cat licking itself.

An aura of gentleness, even playfulness, surrounds the pair shown on the card. The Figure and the Lion look relaxed because they both feel safely held within a relationship built on mutual respect.  Where an archetype like The Magician marshals tools and declares their will, Strength gets things done through exercising soft power: deep listening, skillful negotiation, and reciprocity. These skills only seem like magic. In truth, they are strategies we can learn and then practice behaviors to make facing and resolving disagreements more manageable. Find some teachers.
On a related note, this card might indicate that a relationship needs repair work to happen to continue. We can make amends without denying the original harm or letting it repeat. Revisit harms done to you or by you with fresh eyes and look for opportunities to restore balance. You may never get to hear the apology you deserve or make one that you long to give, and yet you must find a way to let it go.

Not that it’s going to be the walk in the park, never mind the meadow shown on the card. To take responsibility for how our most damaging impulses and fears show up in every aspect of our lives, we must first acknowledge their existence. Yikes! Accountability always takes moral courage and owning our vulnerabilities in a society built on exploitation requires real guts. Holding others accountable is equally tough, especially when we love them or when the behavior stems from addiction or mental health issues. Whichever side of the proverbial street you stand on, clean it up!
Self-expression is tricky in a world built on oppression. We suppress aspects of ourselves because we learned, correctly or not, that expressing them leads to pain and danger. Strength asks us to reclaim the energy spent on repression to conquer shame and find communities where we shine most brilliantly. Where does authenticity feel sticky to you? Resist the urge to start yet another self-improvement project or rush to solve this problem via external means. Allow yourself to feel the spaciousness and grace that come by frankly acknowledging the truth.

Finally, notice that the Figure approaches the Lion fearlessly. Their relationship has a caring vibe. The Strength card reminds us that we all have an expressive power within us that exists beyond the reach of shame or self-deception. Strength in this light looks like someone who has faced their fears with compassion and found a deep well of self-acceptance to draw from as they face the world.

#### SHADOW ASPECTS

Or does the Figure grip the Lion’s jaws as a show of superiority and domination? In the real world, people “train” large cats by controlling access to food, mixing affection with intimidation, and inflicting pain. Violence and head games induce a condition of “learned helplessness” that entrenches the abuse into the cats’ psyches. Honestly, we cheer a little when we hear about one of these cats mauling their captor-trainers.

In Strength’s shadow, we see a dangerous fixation on control. Asserting dominance might feel amazing at the moment, but results in a lack of empathy that ultimately limits growth for all parties involved. We can use this card to examine how this pattern might show up in our relationships.
First, a desire to demonstrate strength might lead to a mindset of overcoming challenges at any cost. This attitude could result in neglecting your well-being or that of others to pursue goals or get external validation. A deadly dog-eat-dog worldview might sneak into our mindset, allowing us to justify all manner of (self-) destructive actions. Next thing you know, this flowery Figure morphs into a latte-guzzling, over-scheduled girlboss who scares the crap out of poor Lion. (Look at the tail between its legs!) Consider how ideologies like scarcity thinking, hustle culture, toxic positivity, or hyper-individualism negatively influence the matter at hand.

Alternatively, we might put on a facade of strength to appear composed and resilient on the outside while struggling internally. This emotional armor causes difficulty in seeking support when needed. This card tells us not only do we need help, we deserve it. Perhaps this card asks you to give or receive a form of support that makes you somehow uncomfortable.

We often confuse self-criticism with self-discipline. Beating yourself up works in some cases or we wouldn’t do it, right? But the costs to our self-esteem and peace of mind can be staggering. Strength suggests that it’s time for a new strategy. Try incorporating self-compassion into your approach to a challenge. Trust that self-discipline can emerge from alignment and self-acceptance.

Love never seeks to control. All forms of domination or deception crush the spirit of awe and reverence that love requires. Yet a fear of losing love can make us feel the need to exert control in subtle ways. For example, we might hide parts of ourselves or start fibbing to manipulate how we’re perceived. If we suspect our partners have begun to grow away from us, we pressure them in similar ways. Some couples go on like this for decades-- will yours?

Perhaps you notice another theme uniting Strength’s shadows: the capacity to endure what ought not to be endured. On an individual level, we experience this shadow when we choose to suppress our feelings rather than deal with conflict openly. Misalignment causes profound distress and still, we’d rather suffer than deal with the discomfort of acknowledging the issue.  We gaslight ourselves, do extra physical or affective labor, or make excuses for a toxic person– anything and everything to protect ourselves from having to make hard choices based on facts. Eventually, the situation explodes, fizzles out, or becomes our new normal. If you’re caught in this trap, Strength’s appearance means you need to get real about the situation or find yourself gnawing off a leg.

Collectively, this shadow strength shows up as political inertia. We vote for “the lesser of two evils” rather than organize ourselves to build a more just and beautiful world. We spin our wheels on social media rather than show up in real life, or any number of other behaviors that disconnect us from our collective strength. Problems with accountability, consent, and cultural appropriation fall into this same category.

In its darkest, most hateful manifestation, this card means fascism. The word fascism comes from the Italian fascia, meaning a bundle of sticks bound together. The image represents the idea of strength in numbers: a bundle can resist a force that would break a solitary stick. It could have been a beautiful metaphor but jabronies took it all the way to crap town.

#### IN READINGS

Tarot practitioners commonly read the Strength card as an amplifier. Its presence emphasizes the influence of that placement and possibly the surrounding cards. When drawn as the signifier (often the first card of a spread) it suggests that the focus of the reading has profound meaning or potential power for the subject.

Watch too for the appearance of Wands, particularly the Queen of Wands. A fiery spread might indicate an extra charge (i.e., higher intensity or greater urgency) to the focus of the reading, especially when it pertains to creativity in some form.
Previous incarnations of the Tarot called this card “Force.” That word carries much more concentrated energy to us, implying a strong and tightly directed use of willpower. See if that interpretation works better for the placement.

Lastly, this sunny archetype moonlights as a curse-breaker. Destructive interpersonal dynamics, ruts that feel impossible to escape, and compulsive behaviors of all sorts can be changed when Strength appears in a relevant placement.

## JOURNAL: SAY GOODBYE TO THE CHARIOT

Last year fell under the archetype of The Chariot (7), which calls up themes related to diligence, mastery, and action. The Driver shown on this card feels not romantic, not cute, but irresistibly sexy. The Figure radiates confidence and determination, linking their formidable charisma and expertise with the power of two “horses” representing our instincts and passions. This archetype is about knowing our self-worth and making bold moves. Its shadow covers excess ambition, burnout, and impulsiveness.

We linked symbols of The Chariot with journal prompts about how this card’s themes showed up in your life in 2023. For each, you’ll first list out what happened last year in that area of your life and then you’ll write about whatever comes up. Contrary to the cliche, we don’t learn from experience— we learn by reflecting on experience, so give this part of the ritual the attention it deserves.

### THE DRIVER

Recall any world events that affected you, plus adult stuff such as changes in living situations, career moves, or creative projects. Also, note any practical skills learned or developed, like renewing your CPR certification. How did you feel about your material conditions? Where did you struggle and where did you thrive? How did you adapt?

### THE HORSES / SPHINXES

Write down any shifts in relationships, deaths or births, health updates, physical self-care habits, and the most memorable highs and lows, emotionally.  emotional highs and lows. What allies (human or otherwise) supported you this year? Have you thanked them, or given them honest feedback?

### THE STAR CROWN

Getting more esoteric, name any emotional or spiritual breakthroughs, mental health therapies or psychological self-care. List communication skills learned or developed, like Nonviolent Communication or boundary setting. Did your ritual practice (witchcraft, magic) and other means of tending your inner garden serve you? How well did your actions align with your values? Do a vibe check.

### THE WHEEL

Take a deep breath and remember points when exasperation, rage, or protective apathy took over. Track numbing or dissociative methods, plus the ruts and re-runs. What crushed me, and how do I feel about how I took care of myself after? How and when did I check out?

Optional: copy items from these prompts that you’d like to release onto bits of paper for later, in The Lion's Remedy Ritual.

CARD 1 - What can you celebrate or accept about 2023?
CARD 2 - What to release?
CARD 3 - What lesson will you carry forward?

## TAROT: THE LEMNISCATE SPREAD

What comes first, the snowflake or the sea? The question has no answer because the water cycle has no distinct beginning or end; it gradually changes form as it flows from one environment to the next. The lemniscate (aka infinity symbol) represents those parts of life that ebb and expand subtly, and we use it here to guide an inquiry into an evolving aspect of your life. Try this spread in a period of slow transition or when you feel an energetic shift as opposed to an abrupt change.

![TAROT_ The Lemniscate Spread](https://github.com/micaelaneus/strength-as-ccoty/assets/5696026/7f206bf2-3930-4a0b-ab9a-5876d42f35d1)

### READING THE SPREAD

If your practice contains a ritual opener such as casting a circle or calling in guides, perform it now. Take a moment to settle into your body. Articulate your query mentally or in writing to strengthen and focus your intention. When you feel ready, shuffle and cut the cards. Place them one by one facing up, or place them all face down and move through the spread by turning them over. Whichever you choose, follow the curves of the lemniscate.

CARD 1 - YOU AT THE POINT OF DEPARTURE: Insight into where you stand at the end of a cycle

CARD 2 - OUTSIDE INFLUENCE: An energy, focus, or external factor with declining significance

CARD 3 - SHRINKING SHADOW: Emotional preoccupation, belief, or vibe to integrate and move on from

CARD 4 - HARVEST BOUNTY: An area or ability, perhaps a struggle, that nears completion

CARD 5 - BURNT OFFERING: Something to surrender as you cycle forward

CARD 6 - OUTSIDE  INFLUENCE: An external element with increasing significance

CARD 7 - SHIFTING SHADOW: Emerging energy or focus for self-reflection and shadow work

CARD 8 - ROOM TO GROW: Aspiration to work toward, or place to improve your awareness

CARD 9 - FRESH SPARK: Something to accept, whether new energy or hard reality

CARD 10 - ENCOURAGING WORD: An opportunity or bit of inspo for the coming period

CARD 11 - WORD OF CAUTION: An aspect of the emerging phase to treat with care

CARD 12 - YOU AT THE MOMENT OF ARRIVAL: Insight into where you stand at the start of a cycle

## PART II: RITUAL STRATEGIES

Culture is ritual: what we do, when and how we do it, and the stories we use to explain our motivation. We may practice in order to renew our dedication to our most enlightened ideals or to sanctify the nitty-gritty work of living. All reasons are good reasons. Celebrate and sustain yourself with rituals, great and small, and you will never get lost in the maze of modern life.  We offer some spare thread and loose buttons, notions you might find useful as you sew the coming year together. *As ye harm none, do as ye will!*

### MINERAL & PLANT ALLIES

Fresh or dried roses and rosewater; edible herbs associated with protection magic such as sage, bay leaf, and rosemary; frankincense above all other incenses but also smudging plants like mugwort or cedar that have fortifying uses (as opposed to healing or cleansing herbs like sage and palo santo); essential oils containing these herbs.

Hardy plants with woody stems make great additions to your altar this year: sprigs of evergreens like pine, juniper, and mistletoe. (No, it’s not just for smooching!) Stout species of brush grow in nearly every climate, so find a new local plant ally. If the element of water rules your Card of the Year (The High Priestess, Death, etc.) then willow, cattails, or other tough marshy plants make nice additions. To those suffering from heartaches or struggling to adapt to a sudden unwelcome change, we recommend getting a Rose of Jericho (*Selaginella lepidophylla*), also called a resurrection plant.

Simple teas with acidic or citrusy flavors evoke the zesty energy and candor of Strength. Find a lemony tea to drink only while doing creative work (perhaps with ginger or other invigorating herb), to build a sense-memory into your practice. Blends that feature Schisandra berries, hibiscus, or even licorice (i.e., gentle detox herbs) complement shadow work. Richly fragrant teas dominated by rose or lavender will always make us think of Leo. You might get overly energized at times this year, so keep calming herbs like chamomile and catnip in the cupboard as well.

Stones with protective associations like tourmaline, tiger’s eye, and agate; gold-toned minerals like mica, chalcopyrite, and literal gold to activate creativity (doubly so when you hope to make money from the effort); those giant juicy-looking pieces of raw calcite for connecting with joy, our emotional superpower; hematite for breaking curses like truly destructive relationship patterns or addictions; pyrite when you struggle to walk away from a situation (job, relationship); bronzite for grace under pressure; jade for endurance or equanimity; turquoise when starting new ventures.

Stones represent Earth, which balances Fire to help resist some of its more manic manifestations. You may find crystals even more useful this year, particularly water-safe varieties.

#### BEWARE BAD VIBES

Choose only ethically sourced herbs and stones, work within your cultural tradition, and shop locally. Don’t taint your magic with settler-colonial ick, especially in a year ruled by an amplifying archetype like Strength. When in doubt, leave it out… of your online shopping cart.

### CREATE POWERFUL ALTARS

While you do not need an altar at home, you may very much enjoy one. Dedicate an area to ritual elements and objects that keep your mind on your magic. Tables are traditional but a corner of your desk, a bookshelf, or a windowsill works perfectly well. If you can’t devote that much space to a complex altar, get devious: a double-page collage in your journal stood upright makes a pleasant background, or try an empty tin of breath mints. All energy spent creating beauty and cultivating joy returns to you, three times three! (All energy spent impressing algorithms is wasted.)
You may find pleasure in honoring or calling in people who incarnate an aspect of the Strength archetype to you. Hero-worship is very shadow-Magician in our minds, but we love to celebrate someone who embodies the sunny side of humanity. Try adding their image to your altar, playing their music while you journal, or eating their favorite foods. Maybe skip smoking their favorite cigarette? Everything that serves life is fair game.

### VISIT POWERFUL ALTARS

You belong to the Earth and every atom sings for you. We long to worship your ineffable wonderfulness at the tops of mountains and crests of high tides. Please go someplace that puts you deeply in touch with your power as one of this planet’s most favored children and we promise to meet you there. (Or at least send a worthy representative to honor you in our stead.) May we suggest a meadow blooming after a flood, a forest regrowing after a wildfire, or a pigeon nesting in the plastic anti-pigeon spikes?

### CAST A SPELL OR PERFORM A RITUAL

This year invites us to perform rituals that increase creativity, make bold changes, and break bad habits.

Consider casting or refreshing spells and talismans you’ve put in place for *protection*. Bless doorways, cleanse your home or other significant space, dust and re-hang wards like nazar amulets, etc. A deep clean of your home, concentrating on areas related to your career and creativity, always feels good. (Yes, we just told you to clean up your desk.) Add purifying allies like lemon juice or rosemary oil to your mop bucket, or spritz the rugs with rosewater after beating them. We have some witchy projects planned this year that we’ll share in the newsletter for folks who get stuck.

We strongly associate Strength with *curse-breaking.* Think of a curse as any pattern that binds you and that you might have inherited from your family of origin or formative peers. For instance, you might break a classic codependent curse like marrying alcoholics by using a combination of ritual and therapy. Or you might feel like someone has fixated on you in a very dark way and you need to sever the attachment with a cord-cutting ceremony. One friend of ours finally threw out his raggedy college futon over ten years after graduating and immediately got offered a full-time contract with the company of his dreams. Ditch any similarly cursed clutter in your life.

Manifesting has gotten some well-deserved critique in the last few years, and we agree with all of it. It takes more than open chakras to get what you need in this capitalist thrill factory. The idea of magical shortcuts for the pure of heart insults us all, and it degrades the principles of radical witchcraft. That said, using ritual to direct your willpower and put yourself in the right headspace to succeed has value in our eyes. For an endeavor where you acknowledge the role of privilege and have a plan to do the work, rituals to *manifest helpers or opportunities* make sense in a Strength year.

## RITUAL: THE LION’S REMEDY

In the Lion’s roar, we hear an undeniable message: you’ve got to feel it to heal it, and the only way out is through. Staying present with difficult emotions is the second step in any healing process and it inspires this ritual. We begin and end with journaling before embarking on a visualization journey to Strength’s meadow. Along the way, we pull cards, do a simple banishing/releasing practice, and cure a Lion of mystical indigestion.  

### MATERIALS

* Journal and tarot deck
* Small scraps of paper
* Candle and burn bowl*
* Other ritual elements such as incense, stone allies, etc.

You may wish to do the initial round of journaling on The Chariot year before the main ritual because honestly, it’s a lot to do in one sitting. Read the entire practice and decide for yourself.

*Any fire-safe container not used for food prep can become a burn bowl to use for the releasing practice. Fireplaces, compost bins, or even toilets work as substitutes. Insert the element that corresponds to your method, like “earth” for composting or “water” for flushing, wherever we invoke fire. Think carefully before adding paper to waterways, though.



### OPEN A RITUAL SPACE

Take some breaths to build focus, calm the mind, and signal to your body that you are entering a different state of being. Sit quietly until you feel perceptibly more centered before continuing.

Mark the transition into the ritual space by lighting a candle, invoking stone and plant allies, burning incense, or doing other ritual strategies. These elements help create a boundary between the ordinary and the sacred, setting this work apart from other day-to-day activities. You do not need any of them, however. Deep breaths and strong intentions do plenty of good all by themselves. If you do have a method for casting a circle, calling the corners, etc. in your practice, perform it here.

Optional: call in any guides, ancestors, or other helpers. Invite them by name and tell them why you seek their presence. Since we are working with themes from Strength, you might call in people who embody one of its aspects or themes. Example: *“Grandma Jo, you dared to leave your husband despite society’s pressure to stay. Share your courage with me today.”*

Announce your reason for performing the ritual and dedicate the merits:
*“I gather here to*[your purpose, even a general desire like “connect with my intuition”], *and I dedicate any merits of my work to all beings [or name a recipient].”*

Prepare your tarot cards and other materials along with any scrap papers for the releasing ritual you may have brought in you Chariot. When you're ready, take a comfortable seat and go through the following visualization.

### TAROT + VISUALIZATION: FINDING THE LION’S REMEDY

You find yourself standing in the center of town having One of Those Days. Traffic is terrible, people are awful, and you can smell your own armpits. Sink into your senses. Connect with the tension of modern life as you imagine yourself sitting on the street, maybe at a bus stop bench or outdoor cafe table. Behind you, you overhear a group of people gossiping about someone they can barely tolerate— it’s you! They’re shredding you apart and having a good laugh.

* Write down what those jerks say about you: every self-criticism, negative thought, stressor, point of tension, etc. on scraps of paper.

You’ve heard enough and feel quite sick of them, this place, and the entire day. Gather your things into a bag and walk out of the town with a determination to salvage your afternoon. Walk until you find yourself in a thick forest, so thick you’re pushing tree branches out of your way. They may snap back to whip your face, and you might stumble over fallen branches. Yet you hear birdsong and breathe fresh air. The forest absorbs and muffles all other sounds, and you no longer hear the town even when straining your ears. You instinctively sigh with relief. The ground gets rockier and the air colder— you’re headed up the side of a mountain.

* Pull a card to represent a challenge faced or lesson learned in the past year.

Keep walking. The slope decreases, therefore you must have passed the peak. Now a dense forest and a tall mountain lay between you and old hassles. Keep walking until you see the trees start to thin and the forest opens into a wide meadow. The earth lies even under your feet, neither compacted nor marshy, and smells profoundly alive. Freed from the constricting density of the forest, you feel a gentle wind on your cheeks. Open your arms wide to embrace this openness.  

* Pull a card to reveal an area of growth or new energy to call in.

You roam about to gaze at the meadow’s splendor, looking for dragonflies or quails but you don’t see any. Instead, at the center of the field, you meet eyes with a Lion. It locks you into the unblinking, all-knowing power stare that cats learn from the Moon. You will have to face this Lion.

* Pull a card to represent an obstacle or a difficult matter to handle this coming year.

Time stops, yet many moments pass. The Lion only looks at you without making a move, and slowly you realize it’s in some kind of distress. An irresistible urge to approach the Lion takes command of your feet. When you reach it, you can tell it’s in an enormous, absolutely soul-crushing amount of pain. You reach out to comfort it, feeling the warmth of its body in the sunlight as you caress it around the ears. You pick a few small burs out of its coat and feel the nubby line of an old scar under its mane. The Lion melts in the face of your compassion, rubbing its face into your hands for more love.

* Pull a card for a supportive energy or practice to help you with the previous card’s challenge.

You instinctively know that the Lion’s remedy lies within its mouth, and therefore you must open the Lion’s jaws. It offers no resistance as you gently work your hands over its muzzle, and it willingly cooperates by opening wider and lolling out its tongue. You feel its hot breath on your knuckles and its saliva over your wrist as you reach down its throat. You reach so deeply into its guts that you feel one of its front teeth dig into your armpit. At that moment, your fingers brush against something the Lion obviously should not have swallowed. Somehow you find a way to reach one more inch so your hand can close around the object. Grasp it firmly and gently tug until the Lion’s gut releases it. Hold on to it as you carefully maneuver your arm out from inside the Lion.

Relieved of this pain and seemingly happy to let you keep the object, the Lion gives you one last sign of its affection and gratitude before happily bounding away. As it disappears into the taller grasses, you examine the recovered object and instantly recognize it as enchanted with powerful magic. You know that it will help you overcome any obstacle and silence those nasty townspeople.

* You found the Lion’s Remedy. What does this object look like, and what powers does it give you?  

Wipe the Lion’s spit off your new totem. You’re bringing this home with you, no question. Unfortunately, all the things you stuffed into your bag back in town mean you don’t have the space to carry it.  You decide to empty your bag of anything non-essential.

* Gather the scraps of paper from the first step of the ritual and prepare your method for releasing them; we use a candle and burn bowl.
* Lift a scrap in your right hand and recite a one-line banishing spell (examples below) as you carefully set it aflame. If you wish to read it or name what you’re releasing (very optional), use only the briefest description possible. Retelling the story essentially re-activates it, reinforcing those neural pathways, at the exact moment we want it to fade away.
* One-line banishing spells in order of increasing intensity:
  * *By fire, I return this energy [or brief description] to its source. May it flow to the place where it does the most good— it’s no longer needed here.*
  * *By the power of fire, I surrender and release you, ending all attachments. May you go to serve life in a new form, in a new place.*
  * *By fire, I banish you. For my highest good, I banish you. To serve life [or a specific cause], I banish you.*
  * [Begin by naming the issue, or simply say:] *I cast you out. I no longer desire your presence in my life, your energy is unwelcome, and so you must go. By fire, I burn and banish you. Do not return.*
  * *With this flame and by my will, I reclaim all power from you*[or brief description]. *From this moment until the end of time, I am safe from your control. This fire has cleansed my life of your influence, and I am free.* [At “power”, name anything you want to call back like dignity, financial freedom, or romantic longing.]
* When you finish releasing every bit of old baggage, close out this portion of the ritual by speaking a version of the following phrase:
  * *May this flame find and release any negative energy, attachment, or influence not yet named which does me harm, for my good and the good of all beings.*
* Use incense, smudging herbs, or essential oils to clear the air. Peeling citrus and adding the rinds to hot water works as well, and so does simply opening a window. If you’ve been using a dedicated banishing-protecting candle (often black), extinguish it. Leave your ritual candle burning.

Now that you’ve cleaned out your bag, you find the enchanted Lion's Remedy fits perfectly, and carrying it is no trouble. Content with your adventure, you pause for a moment to soak in the delicious power of the meadow before heading back toward the mountain to home.

* Pull a card for insight, aspiration, or potential benefit gained by this work.

#### JOURNAL

Do some final journaling before closing.

1. Review the cards you pulled along your journey. What story do they tell? Journal about your takeaways.
2. Tell us more about what you called in when you reached the meadow.
3. Consider what meanings and associations the Lion’s Remedy token evokes in your imagination. Why did you find this object, as opposed to some other?
4. How did you feel after cleaning out your purse?

Taking all these ideas into consideration, set an intention for the next few months. Write it down in a clear sentence that spells out (sorry) what you desire and what action/s you will perform to manifest it. Remember that intentions capture processes and actions that we control; goals focus on outcomes, which we may not control. Be sure to set an intention.

* *“I’m going to get a job.”* Just okay.
* *“I will end this period of financial hardship by finding three ways to broaden my job search, canceling my avocado toast subscription, and getting Luisa to critique my resume.”* Very yes!

#### CLOSE THE RITUAL SPACE

When you feel complete, close your circle according to your practice or simply say something like: *“May all helpers gathered here go in peace with my gratitude, and may the work done here be for the good of all.  So concludes my ritual.”*

### THE LION’S REMEDY IN THE OPEN CIRCLE

1. For the next eight days, read or speak your intention aloud to yourself as you perform an everyday act of self-care. Stick a piece of paper with your intention written on it between the bristles of your hairbrush and recite it as you groom yourself every morning, right into the mirror.  as you groom. Enchant your lip gloss, moisturizer, or inhaler– anything you use at least once per day and relates to self-care.

2. Keep a tangible version of your Lion’s Remedy totem near you for the next eight days, or the duration of your intention. Translate more fantastical totems that don’t fit in your pocket, like a hot air balloon and bolt cutters, into an everyday item that loosely correlates. A hot air balloon might turn into a heater, or bolt cutters into kitchen shears, for example.

3. Want your magic to last? Solidarity is forever! Take time to support a collective effort related to the fears and obstacles you banished with the Lion’s Remedy. For instance, someone who cleansed a bad relationship might volunteer at (or donate to) a local shelter for domestic abuse survivors. Feel like your job or living situation is a prison? Help others literally escape by contributing to the National Bail-Out. Picking up litter would work for any issue— bless some work gloves with your intention and fill a bag.

## PART III: ASTROLOGY

The stars do not map out our lives; they only show us the edges of our comfort zones. We incorporate the zodiac into our practice because it gives us tools to see ourselves from new angles, and that stimulates growth. Astrology should put us in touch with our limits and motivate us to test them, joyfully and compassionately, as acts of cosmic self-love. We envision your life as a luminous jewel spinning in space, every facet a wonder to behold, and hope this work inspires you to go star-gazing with us.

### THE SUN & LEO

As the eighth card in the Major Arcana, the Strength card aligns with the 8th House and is ruled by Leo and the Sun. (The RWCS creators moved this card from its old position as the eleventh card for this reason.) Creativity, fruitful labor, and charisma get a boost from the collective power of these elements. The Sun urges us to express ourselves candidly, sharing our brilliance with others confidently. Leo takes passion to a higher level, giving us an unparalleled ability to attract others to our flames. This combo benefits artists of all mediums, certainly, but other professions may also get a beneficial bump of success and recognition. The generosity shown in this period has an exceptional power to do good to the receiver and the giver whether in material resources or acts of service, second chances, or forgiveness.

This pairing rewards boldness but cautions against overreaching: egomania, greed, workaholism, and jealousy must be curbed. All matters of the 8th House merit consideration during this period, and they do get tricksy! This house relates to transformations, gray areas, and energetic exchanges, which makes this year a fantastic time to shake up any patterns you’re tired of reliving.

### FIRE & THE SUIT OF WANDS

Leo brings the element of Fire to Strength, tying this card to the Suit of Wands. Fire and Wands share a vigorous energy associated with intuition, craftsmanship, and grassroots political action. Our instinct to challenge ourselves to grow creatively or to break destructive patterns gets a boost from their cooperative energies. Unfortunately, these sparks do tend to start wildfires when unbalanced. Watch out for ambition for its own sake, snark, and a certain impulsive selfishness.

Three of the twelve astrological signs have the element of Fire, each in one of the three modalities (Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable). Modalities add nuance to how that element operates in that sign. Leo’s Fire is Fixed, meaning the most mature and stabilizing expression of its influence. It beats out a steady rhythm for Strength to play over, setting a tone of commitment and trustworthiness for this year’s endeavors. Fixed Fire’s shadow qualities relate to excessive inertia, making us slow to evolve or compromise when needed.

### STRENGTH IN YOUR NATAL SKY

Incorporating astrology is an easy and effective way to personalize how you work with aspects of Strength. You’ll need your natal chart, which many online sources will calculate for free (see *Resources and References*). Once you have it, note the signs and planets for 1)your 8th House, 2) the house ruled by Leo, and 3) the house hosting your Sun.

Each of these houses relates to the themes, struggles, and opportunities of an area of your life. Unfortunately, we can’t go into each possible placement in this guide (cough, newsletter) so you’ll have to look them up yourself or find an experienced astrologer. When you get a sense of the house meanings, take inventory of those aspects of your life both externally (as they manifest to others) or internally (as beliefs, shadows, or self-talk patterns).

For instance, someone with Venus in Leo in the 8th House should check in with their romantic life– history, current status, ideas about love, attachment style, the evolution of their sexual and gender identity, etc. Maybe they see very literal changes to make such as starting to date again or making some requests in the bedroom. More abstractly, they could choose to begin healing attachment issues or increasing self-love. A secondary area might be aesthetics generally. Strength invites Venus-in-Leo to revamp their image (wardrobe, social media presence), refresh their home decor, or simply spend more time appreciating the arts this year.

Work through the relevant aspects of your natal chart using our Venus-in-Leo example to inspire you. Each astrological element provides another window into yourself. You may or may not like what you see, and that will tell you where to focus your intentions in the coming year.

## TAROT: THE TWELVE HOUSES SPREAD

Zodiac spreads take us on a journey from our innermost selves in the First House, through the houses governing our relationships and careers, until arriving in the mysterious Twelfth House. Each house corresponds to a sign, therefore this spread takes us through a complete year starting with Aries in March. Use the Twelve Houses to get a sense of how you stand and decide where to go deeper in the coming year.

![TAROT_ The Twelve Houses Spread](https://github.com/micaelaneus/strength-as-ccoty/assets/5696026/7d0c22f5-a844-40d7-9712-20933249f18d)


### BEFORE YOU BEGIN

This spread is complex, not gonna lie. Reading it gets both easier and richer the more you understand astrology and your natal chart, and puzzling through this spread is one way to build that expertise. Hang in there.

Zodiac spreads have moments when they feel most helpful. First, the start of a new year in whatever calendars you use (Gregorian, lunar, Jewish, etc.) as well as at the spring equinox (aka the astrological “new year”) and your birthday. Secondly, any other time you experience a major reset event such as a big move, change in your relationship status, career shift, etc.

We do not recommend zodiac spreads at the birth/adoption of a child when done for the child! Tarot readings generally cannot be done without the consent and participation of one key subject, anyway, and this spread isn’t meant to deliver lifelong predictions. (Get a natal chart analysis instead.) However, this spread may be very helpful for the new parent to get insight into this period of their own lives.

Lastly, we fully encourage you to riff on the prompts below to match any question you have for that house. For instance, someone who recently “came out” (in any sense of the phrase) may have a very clear concern to explore in their First House. We preferred to give a cluster of questions rather than an explicit label for the card placements so your intuition has room to wiggle. Answer the question that feels most resonant to you.

### READING THE TWELVE HOUSES

If your practice contains a ritual opener such as casting a circle or calling in guides, perform it now. Take a moment to center yourself with a few deep breaths and settle into your body. Articulate your query mentally or in writing to strengthen and focus your intention.

When you feel ready, shuffle and cut the cards. Place all twelve cards face down, starting at the First House and moving counter-clockwise to pull a card for each successive house. Placing all cards face-up will overwhelm your reading, believe! Lay out the complete map and then take the journey one step at a time.

Before you reveal each card, read the prompts to marinate in the house’s juices. Then turn the card over and make your interpretation before moving to the next house. We recommend brief journaling both before and after you flip each card.

#### CARD 1 - FIRST HOUSE OF IDENTITIES ASCENDANT

What area of personal growth would most benefit from attention now? Where do I need to cultivate more self-confidence, or express myself with greater authenticity? How do I need to change, perhaps dramatically?

CARDINAL FIRE + MARS + ARIES // THE EMPEROR + THE TOWER

#### CARD 2 - SECOND HOUSE OF PRACTICALITIES

How am I supported, and where do I lack support? What aspect of my life deserves more pleasure and ease? Where does stubbornness or stale belief hold me back from achievement and growth? Am I too attached?

FIXED EARTH + VENUS + TAURUS // THE EMPRESS + THE HIEROPHANT

#### CARD 3 - THIRD HOUSE OF COMMUNION

Do my friendships and community serve my highest self? Do I serve theirs? How do my communication patterns impact my relationships? Where do I step up, or maybe step back, in collaborations? Am I in love?

MUTABLE AIR + MERCURY + GEMINI // THE MAGICIAN + THE LOVERS

#### CARD 4 - FOURTH HOUSE OF BELONGING IMUM COELI (IC)

An emotional vibe check. How am I doing, in the most holistic sense imaginable? Is my “home” stable, meaning both practically secure (finances, agreements) and well-regulated (low drama, cheery)?

CARDINAL WATER + THE MOON + CANCER // THE HIGH PRIESTESS + THE CHARIOT + THE MOON

#### CARD 5 - FIFTH HOUSE OF CREATIVITIES

Where and when do my unique gifts shine? How confident do I feel sharing myself, authentically? Does my creativity get enough attention? Should I take the next step in a project? What am I so afraid of?

FIXED FIRE + THE SUN + LEO // STRENGTH + THE SUN

#### CARD 6 - SIXTH HOUSE OF EMBODIMENTS

Do my habits support my physical and mental health? How healthy do I feel, regardless of what a doctor might say? What energy or practice will help me enjoy my body more fully? Where can I release perfectionism?

MUTABLE EARTH / MERCURY / VIRGO // THE MAGICIAN + THE HERMIT

#### CARD 7 - SEVENTH HOUSE OF PARTNERSHIPS DESCENDANT

Do I form trustworthy partnerships? How well do my boundaries serve my well-being? What area of my life faces conflict, and therefore offers growth? Where can I better show up for community? Where do I have more to offer the folks in my intimate life?

CARDINAL AIR + VENUS + LIBRA  // THE EMPRESS + JUSTICE

#### CARD 8 - EIGHTH HOUSE OF TRANSFORMATIONS

What pattern can I release? What energy do I need to call in or let flow out of me? Where has my rigidity or desire for control hurt me or others? How have I grown in the period of my life now ending? How’s my sex life?

FIXED WATER + PLUTO + SCORPIO // DEATH + JUDGMENT

#### CARD 9 - NINTH HOUSE OF PHILOSOPHIES

Do my actions align with my ethics? How open am I (or should I be) for experiences that expand my perspective like travel, education, discomfort? Am I in a rut? Or is this a season for trust? What can I teach others?

MUTABLE FIRE + JUPITER + SAGITTARIUS // THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE + TEMPERANCE

#### CARD 10 - TENTH HOUSE OF LEGACIES MEDIUM COELI (MC)

Have I honored my responsibilities? What area of my life merits more discipline, and which needs less compulsive fixation? Do I set and keep meaningful goals appropriately? Where should I lighten up? Or maybe buckle down?

CARDINAL EARTH + SATURN + CAPRICORN // THE DEVIL + THE WORLD

#### CARD 11 - ELEVENTH HOUSE OF COLLABORATORS

Vast communities hold and nurture us– societies and ecologies, internal and ancestral. How well do I treat my collaborators? What’s one aspect that deserves extra appreciation? How can I improve my communal presence?

FIXED AIR + URANUS + AQUARIUS // THE FOOL + THE STAR

#### CARD 12 - TWELFTH HOUSE OF MYSTERIES

Dreams, fantasies, wishes, regrets, inner voices, and callings. What intuitive aspect of my life has the greatest power over me now? Do I need to manifest this energy, or release it? Where can I let intuition guide me more outrageously?

MUTABLE WATER + NEPTUNE + PISCES // THE HANGED ONE + THE MOON

### INTERPRETING THE SPREAD

Do a vibe check on the groupings and placements discussed below. Look for associated Major Arcana cards, a preponderance of cards from the same suit, your Card of the Year (see the following section), and of course, Strength. Does this add nuance or noise? Your gut will tell you.

#### HOUSE GROUPINGS

Dividing the sky into twelve parts creates a symmetry to explore for even more insight. Houses that oppose or mirror one another form groups with significance:

* Angular Houses (1, 4, 7, 10) represent areas to take initiative and embrace greater prominence.
* Succedent Houses (2, 5, 8, 11) show us places to trust for stability and support when we focus.
* Cadent Houses (3, 6, 9, 12) imply fluidity. Here, we benefit from adaptivity and cooperation.

#### THE ANGLES

We indicated where  the Ascendant, Descendant, Imum Coeli (IC), and Medium Coeli (MC) sit in the spread because they too carry unique significance that may enhance your reading:

* Ascendant reflects your point of view, whether conscious or unconscious.
* IC might indicate an energy/resource/relationship that is a stabilizing foundation or entrenched pattern.
* Descendant highlights the influence of (or impact on) your relationship/s.
* MC emphasizes the power of legacies (inheritances we receive or bestow, reputations, etc.)

#### OPPOSING HOUSES

Astrologers offer one further–and simpler!– grouping to consider, the opposing house pairs:

* Identity and Ally (Houses 1 and 7) connect a part of yourself with a supporter.
* Cause and Effect (Houses 2 and 8) show how your choice has ripple effects.
* Friends and High Places (Houses 3 and 9) identify connections and how they shape your opportunities.
* Intention and Impact (Houses 4 and 10), aka “how it started” and “how it's going”
* Spark and Bellows (Houses 5 and 11) illuminate your creative spark and who/what fans its flames.
* Body and Soul (Houses 6 and 12) unite your embodied self and inner realms.

Calling these houses opposing implies antagonism and contradiction;  we prefer to call them complementing. They’re more dynamic duo than arch-enemies and hey, sometimes couples fight! That doesn’t mean they don’t love you.

## TAROT: THE OPEN HOUSE MINI SPREAD

You might find that one of your twelve houses warrants a closer look, perhaps starting with the house that corresponds to the Strength card (8th House) or the house of your sun sign. We made this mini-spread inspired by the themes of the four quadrants to help you dig into a house a bit deeper.

![TAROT_ The Twelve Houses Spread (3)](https://github.com/micaelaneus/strength-as-ccoty/assets/5696026/6dc12fbc-db59-4ef0-9760-9e200a48f59a)


1 - SELF: A dominant energy or expression of this house in your life, currently.
2 - ORIGINS: An external factor (past or present) affecting concerns governed by this house
3 - OTHERS: The vibe you send out to others in these matters, or the impact this house has on relationships
4 - SHADOWS: An unacknowledged aspect of this house, positive or negative, that you’re ready to integrate

## PART IV: YOUR CARD OF THE YEAR

Just as we share Strength as our Collective Card of the Year, each of us has an archetype from the Major Arcana that serves as a personal Card of the Year (COTY). Working with collective and personal cards separately and as a complementing pair gives us more opportunities for growth while still providing some structure. Finding your COTY is the first step.

### SELECT AN ARCHETYPE FOR 2024

Add up the digits of the month and date of your birthday with the current year. If the total is greater than 21, reduce by adding the digits again. The final sum corresponds to a card in the Major Arcana and will be your Card of the Year (COTY).

You might get two different cards based on how you add the numbers. Pamela Coleman Smith, who illustrated the tarot deck,  was born on February 16th, 1878. She might calculate her card in 2024 like 16 + 2 + 2024 = 2042 = 2 + 0 + 4 + 2 = 8 (Strength) or 1 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 17 (The Star). Since 17 < 21, she could decide not to reduce any further. For numbers > 22, reduce again.

Why 22, when 21 (The World) is the highest card? The Major Arcana begins at card 0 with The Fool and it’s not possible for a date to ever add up to zero– that’s subtraction! (#mathwhiz)  Many folks, we included, use 22 to indicate a year of The Fool to accommodate.

Or don’t do any arithmetic and go with your gut. Maybe you spent last year dancing with The Devil (15), not playing games with The Magician (1) as promised by the math method. You may decide to work with The High Priestess (2) in 2024, or spend some time in The Sun (19). Make the choice that feels right and remember– you can’t break the rules because there aren’t any.

One word of caution: beware of wishful thinking. You may want to go clubbing with The Lovers (6) without first getting bounced by The Hierophant (5), but that’s rarely how growth happens. Feeling a little apprehensive or disoriented might mean that this is exactly where you need to put in the work. (Psychologists call this “resistance”.) Only you can say for sure, however, so take an honest look at your motivations before choosing.

### EXPLORE STRENGTH & YOUR CARD OF THE YEAR

Now that you’ve chosen a Card of the Year (COTY), we can explore how it intersects with the core themes of the Strength archetype. Fish your COTY and the Strength card out of your RWCS deck and grab your journal.

* What relationship do you imagine these cards having with one another? Would they get along, get bored, or get in a fight? (Cards without a Figure still have personality, look at The Tower.)
* Make note of any non-human imagery these cards share that seems meaningful to you along with any emotions or associations it calls up, no matter how strange they seem. For instance, the lemniscates floating above The Magician (2) and Strength might remind you of the boundless nature of cosmic time, or your sister’s ankle tattoo. Write them both down.
* Which of Strength’s core themes or shadows have jumped out at you so far? We’re looking for the elements of this archetype that immediately tickle your intuition. Do any aspects elicit curiosity, dread, or other notable emotion? Memories or associations?
* How might the energy of your COTY amplify or add nuance to those themes? For instance, you might feel that Temperance (15) highlights Strength’s forgiveness and equanimity. Think of your COTY as Strength’s wing-person, talking up their good points to a hottie. Now reverse the question. How does Strength hype your COTY?
* Do you see places where these cards might have a bad influence on one another? Will your COTY exacerbate Strength’s tendency for egomania, for instance?
* Look for ways that your COTY could balance and support you when the hard parts of Strength show up in the coming year, and vice versa. Concentrate on the themes that jumped out at you earlier or resonate with your life currently.

Wrap up your journal exercise by choosing a little slogan or motto for the coming year that captures the spirit of your new team. You don’t need the world’s most poetic one-liner to get value here, so pick a phrase today knowing that you can change it when lightning strikes.

#### WHEN YOUR CARD OF THE YEAR IS STRENGTH

A double-Strength year, yay! Also, woof. Whatever happens, this year promises to transform you. You can use the same journal prompts listed above because haven’t you wondered what, um, meeting yourself would be like? Imagine overhearing the Figure talking to themselves or their fur-baby Lion.
We do have one additional prompt for double-Strengthies:

* Every archetype has an internal equilibrium, a yin-yang balance that generates wholeness. Match any shadow elements you wrote down in the previous question with a stabilizing quality that Strength also possesses. Counteract workaholism with the powerful sense of embodiment that this Figure radiates from head to toe, for instance, and put some playdates in your calendar to get yourself outside.

Finish by selecting one or more short mottos for the year ahead as described above.

## TAROT: THE MUTUAL AID SPREAD

As you get to know them, the archetypes of the Major Arcana start to feel like a group of long-time friends. Some get on like gangbusters, some obviously slept together, and a few inevitably bicker. Use this spread to check on how your COTY vibes with Strength, and where you might need to mediate. One more thing: we show the cards in an X-shape to signify the energies are intersecting, not “crossing” as in the common +-shaped overlap.

![TAROT_ The Mutual Aid Spread](https://github.com/micaelaneus/strength-as-ccoty/assets/5696026/5322018c-a421-4090-9bbf-30b7afd18093)


### READING THE SPREAD

Ground yourself by taking deep breaths, opening a ritual space, or centering with another method in your practice.

Pull two cards to establish how Strength (Card 1) and your COTY (Card 2) see you, presently. The next pair reveals existing energy or expertise related to the themes of Strength (Card 3) and your COTY (Card 4) that you bring to the situation. This pairing hints at how you might get these archetypes to team up to help you in times ahead. The second set shows contradicting desires, characteristics, or patterns of Strength (Card 6) and COTY (Card 7). They may clash, or simply confuse one another. These placements reveal prospective tensions. The final pair points to one of Strength’s themes that either balances or encourages an aspect of your COTY (Card 7) and conversely, the COTY card theme with Strength (Card 8). In other words, how they bring out the best in one another.

Pause. Shift your perspective so that rather than eight individual cards, you see the spread as one unified image that conveys a message. A query might bubble up inside you. Hold either the spread’s message or this query in mind as you pull a final card to reveal a message co-authored by your allies for the year (Card 9).

## PART V: OPEN CIRCLE WORK

All strength is collective strength. Microbiota co-create our bodies, and it takes co-regulation to keep them going. Our species gravitates into groups, whether sitting around a fire or on folding chairs like at a meeting, and solitary confinement is torture. The work of radical witches begins with casting a circle but it doesn’t stop when we close it because the magic we summon is meant to change the world. That takes practical effort— strategy, solidarity, sweat– and we expect to see y’all in the streets in 2024! Until then, here are other ideas for making magic.

### EMBRACE EMBODIMENT

Both the word and archetype Strength quite naturally evoke the body as a source of power and beauty. What bliss! But in keeping with our shadow theme (“capitalism ruins everything”), this same card brings up all manner of anti-body ideology: ableism, ageism, fatphobia, and other goop. These ideas only pretend to want the best for the body; in fact, they never cease to invent new ways for us to dissociate, disparage, and destroy ourselves.

Instead, we can make this year about reclaiming our wrinkly-rolly selves by uplifting the awesome aspects of Strength and consciously wrestling with its shadows. First, pick a loving practice to root yourself into flesh like stretching before bed or using your fist to practice french-kissing. Lift weights without making it a referendum on your self-worth or gender identity, and vow to touch more trees. Start the revolution in one sentence: *I Never Criticize My Body.*

Next, deal with the shadows by learning about ableism, body inclusivity, and the Three Furies of Disembodiment: Beauty, Diet, and Wellness Cultures. These ideas affect every one of us (some more directly than others), which makes changing them a collective responsibility. Pick one topic to study up on, and remember to put what you learn into practice.

### GATHER COUNCIL

At some point every day, preferably in the morning, recite the name of every non-human creature you know in a 20-mile radius,  whether animal, plant, fungal, geological, or microbial. Stellar jay, coyote, lodgepole pine, Yuba River, hummingbird moth, manzanita, granite… locate yourself in the ecological community and marvel at your place in an incomprehensibly vast web of relationships. Gather these neighbors into a council and turn to them when it’s time to make decisions. What does it look like to take a crow’s advice?

No, we’re not speaking metaphorically. To adapt to climate change healthfully, we must re-wild our worldview. This requires us to act in concordance with the species around us via dialogue, not positioning ourselves as outside observers who then theorize about what we see. Call these allies into your circle because you are willing to listen to what they say and respond by adjusting your actions. Coming into an equal exchange is a subtle shift away from imagining humans as either dominant or subservient to other beings. (Hint: this is easier if you learn to identify more species.)

Writer Sophie Strand created this simple but powerful ritual and shared it publicly. We put a link to one of her pieces about this practice in *Resources & References*.

### FORM AN AFFINITY GROUP

We all see the threats waiting in the coming year, and therefore we must prepare to meet them collectively. When two-to-five people organize themselves to do political work, an affinity group is born. Affinity groups let us attend larger actions safely as well as take direct action independently, according to the shared visions of its members. Invite a few like-minded friends to get together now, before the action heats up, to discuss what kind of direct actions you might want to take together. Never pressure anyone to join or agree to an action! Commitment is key, and that requires authenticity and consent. Discuss what’s fun, what’s scary, when you’ll meet to go somewhere, and what you might feel comfortable doing once you get there.

Talk about how you’ll check in with one another during an action, and how you’ll decide to leave. Talk about disability, arrest-ability, meds, childcare, etc. Find out which causes matter most to folks and how they expect to see them attacked, then get ice cream and go roller-skating. We are forming affinity groups for collective power, not doom squads. *Militant joy FTW!*

### RE-ENCHANT YOUR LIFE

In the past, people worked with beautiful tools built to honor and inspire those who used them. Industrial capitalism took that away, robbing daily life of some of its sparkle. Take it back by re-framing the mundane or sanctifying your tools.

* Write your to-do list poetically. Don’t go to the dentist— polish your seashells.
* Turn your morning mug into a sacred vessel. Fill it with stone and plant allies that attract the power you want to infuse into your life and leave it under a full moon.
* Enchant your commute by attaching mantras or intentions to places you pass, or divining your personal omens. Crossing that bridge or overpass brings you into a new realm, and a hawk on that telephone poll means you should make love as soon as possible.
* Sanctify one of the super fat Sharpies and a bag of random stickers as magic wands and sigils, then keep them handy so you can cover up fascist graffiti in public restrooms.
* Get some cuter pajamas and tell everyone about your new spacesuit.

### CHECKLIST FOR STRENGTH YEAR

This guide gave several ways to work with Strength to extend your tarot and ritual practice. We’ve listed them here along with the prep work for the structured exercises:

* Get a tarot deck and journal
* Sign up for the Touchwood Tarot newsletter at <www.touchwoodtarot.com>
* Download your natal chart
* Find your astrological houses associated with Strength
* Create a motto for 2024 (see The Lion’s Remedy Ritual)
* Enlist some mineral and plant allies (ethical sources only)
* Choose your Card of the Year
* Pick a practice for embracing embodiment
* Exorcise one of Strength’s demons (ableism, gender essentialism, etc.)
* Form an affinity group for collective action

## CLOSING

Like many of you, we come to the end of 2023 steeped in grief and simmering with rage.

Tremendous loss in our own lives, chief among them the death of Leigh Clare from cancer at Samhain, along with an ever-lengthening list of global atrocities has made this past year a real doozy. Truthfully, we wrote this guide for ourselves. A sense of dread started to poison our days, and the only reliable antidote was radical witchcraft. The courage and conviction of the Strength archetype has arrived in the nick of time, in our opinion, and we’re ready to roll up our sleeves. We hope the material presented here gives you some tools to work with this card for the highest good, too.

We want to thank our friend, Erin Kenny, for the many ways she affirmed and encouraged us over the last year. We were introduced virtually by Amanda Yates Garcia, the Oracle of LA, whose teachings heavily influenced this guide. Join her Mystery Cult, buy her books, and listen to the Between the Worlds Podcast.

Lastly, we want to thank everyone who shows the eff up and will continue to stand by our side in 2024.

Thank you, witches!

We begin publishing seasonal guides in March with Aries, the astrological new year. These guides include new journal prompts, altar inspo, and rituals for Strength in each astrological season. Paid subscribers receive guidance on working with their Card of the Year in conjunction with Strength.

We have too many tarot and astrological references to name! We’ll share them in the newsletter.
