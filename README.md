## How to Use This Guide
### Gather your supplies
#### GET A JOURNAL
This guide is optimized for printing in whole or part based on your needs and desires, using only black-and-white ink, narrow margins, and meaningful page breaks. With a minimalist design, you won’t find much space to take notes within the guide itself. Secondly, we have laid out the structure for a very active practice involving self-reflection, somatic exercise, and real-world challenges. You’re gonna need a journal to keep up!

#### SELECT A TAROT DECK
This guide uses the classic deck illustrated by Pamela Coleman Smith that comes with the “little white book” of interpretations written by Arthur Edward Waite and originally published in 1909 by Rider & Son of London. You will hear it called by some combination of those three names: the Rider-Waite, the Waite-Smith, or even the Rider-Waite-Coleman-Smith deck are all common variants. We refer to it as the RWCS to cover all these cases and whatever you choose to call it, it is the most recognizable version of the Tarot. 

While we believe you’ll get the most from this guide if you have a standard WCS deck to explore, we support your choice to choose another deck from this lineage. Many modern tarot artists have adapted the ideas and storylines of the RWCS deck and we list some of our favorites in Resources and References. You can always refer to the Wikipedia entry for the deck to see an image of each card in its original design. 

Note that we use the Strength-Justice ordering to interpret The Fool’s Journey, which might alter the meaning for decks with the less common Justice-Strength ordering. 
#### CREATE AN ALTAR SPACE
Get creative: a corner of your desk, a double-page spread of your journal, a spot on your nightstand, etc. We offer more specific ideas about altar items to evoke elements of Strength in the Ritual Strategies section of this guide; generally, you might expect to use candles, a container for water, incense, herbs or flowers, stones or crystals, and other small objects.

## INTRODUCING Strength as Our Collective Card of the Year
**The Eighth Key directs our energy toward balancing the raw power of our will with an enlightened attitude of acceptance. Strength expresses itself candidly, never dimming the flame of its desire or hiding its vulnerability, and thus approaches invincibility. This key follows The Chariot, when we learn to make our way through the world, and prepares us to pass The Hermit’s more esoteric tests.**
### Symbolism
#### THE LION’S JAWS
The card’s central image shows a Figure grasping the open jaws of a lion. Many say this act symbolizes taming or mastering one's instinctual nature, which strongly implies that our most basic desires are destructive. We agree that the lion represents an element of primal energy inherent in embodiment. Its relationship with the Figure, however, seems filled with mutual trust, affection, and even playfulness. Holding the lion’s jaws now seems like an act of collaboration between the unruly truths of existence and a mind with the Strength to engage them gracefully. The jaws themselves represent that liminal edge between trust and risk that we call vulnerability. 
#### THE LEMNISCATE AKA INFINITY SYMBOL
This well-known graphic floating above the Figure’s head connects them to the ethereal, offering a point of balance to the otherwise lusty fleshiness of this card. A lemniscate loops endlessly over and around itself, suggesting an active energy that nevertheless stays in harmony with the greater universe. Its presence here reminds us that although Strength primarily relates to our personal power, we must stay in alignment to realize the lessons of this key fully.
#### THE WHITE ROBE + INWARD GAZE
White robes symbolize purity, spiritual clarity, and the alignment of one's actions with higher principles.  Traditionally, we wear all white as initiates, as (don’t laugh) virginal brides, and finally as shrouds. Seeing the Figure where this simple robe rather than armor or some costly fabric associated with aristocratic lords like silk tells us we’re not dealing with those forms of power. This Strength enters humbly, a perpetual novice not afraid of their next rite of passage. Notice that the calm and somewhat inward gaze of the Figure is directed into the lion’s eyes, not outward into our own as in most cards in the first half of the Major Arcana. We take this to mean that Strength has the discipline to stay in their lane, keep their eyes on their own paper, and never read the comments. 
#### FLOWERS + WREATHS
The vibrant foliage adorning the Figure’s waist and crown exudes joy– a bold shout that says, huzzah for Life! In a socio-economic system built on constraint, blossoming takes Strength. Think of the audacity shown by flowers growing along a highway median, pushing up through the asphalt designed to destroy them. Or picture the vivid genitalia-like bloom of the orchid. No shame, baby. Do you have the courage of a dandelion?
Correspondences
#### FIXED FIRE + WANDS
The active energy of Fire aligns well with the Suit of Wands, which is associated with intuition, craftsmanship, and grassroots political action. Our instinct to challenge ourselves to grow creatively or to break destructive patterns gets a boost from their energies. Unfortunately, these sparks tend to start wildfires when unbalanced. Watch out for workaholism, ambition for its own sake, and a certain impulsive selfishness.
#### THE SUN + LEO
As the eighth card in the Major Arcana, the Strength card aligns with the 8th House, ruled by Leo and the Sun. (The RWCS tradition moved this card from the 11th position for this reason.) Creativity, fruitful labor, and charisma get a boost from the collective power of these elements. The Sun urges us to express ourselves candidly, sharing our brilliance with others confidently. Leo takes passion to a higher level, giving us an unparalleled ability to attract others to our flames. This combo benefits artists of all mediums, certainly, but other professions may also get a beneficial bump of success and recognition. Generosity shown in this period has an exceptional power to do good to the receiver and the giver whether in material resources or acts of service, second chances, or forgiveness. 

This pairing rewards boldness but cautions against overreaching: egomania, greed, workaholism, and jealousy must be curbed. All matters of the 8th House merit consideration during this period, and they get tricksy! This house relates to transformations, gray areas, and energetic exchanges, making this year a fantastic time to shake up any patterns you’re tired of reliving. 
### Interpretation
In essence, the Strength card encourages us to draw on courage, and compassion to navigate challenges with forceful conviction. This card encourages individuals to confront their fears, embrace challenges, and cultivate resilience on their journey toward self-discovery. As our Collective Card of the Year, it promises a period of tremendous growth and expansive possibilities that flourish despite obstacles. The roses winding around the Figure’s waist and crown may have thorns, certainly– and yet nothing stops their blooming. 

This card says, you can do it! Mercifully, it also gives us some hints on how.

Look first at the peaceful expression on The Figure’s face. It tells us that the kind of robust resilience we seek does not come through domination and control. Instead, we find strength through self-acceptance and equanimity. Celebrating our power helps us overcome our fears, a major theme of this card. We develop a healthy sense of ego by first meeting life’s challenges and then taking a moment to appreciate our newfound abilities. Reflect on a time you’ve been a bit bolder than you thought possible. Luxuriate in the feeling, regardless of the outcome. Savor yourself with the same shameless delight of a cat licking itself.

An aura of gentleness, even playfulness, surrounds the pair shown on the card. The Figure and the Lion look relaxed because they both feel safely held within a relationship built on mutual respect.  Where The Magician marshalls tools and declares their will, Strength gets things done through exercising soft power: deep listening, skillful negotiation, and reciprocity. These skills only seem like magic. In truth, they are strategies we can learn and then practice behaviors to make facing and resolving disagreements more manageable. Find some teachers.

On a related note, this card might indicate that repair work must happen in a relationship. Strength understands both apology and forgiveness without denying the harm that makes them necessary. You may never get to hear the apology you deserve or make one that you long to give, and yet you must find a way to let it go. Revisit harms done to you or by you with fresh eyes and look for opportunities to restore balance. (Forgiveness may not meet your needs, and that’s okay.)

Not that it’s going to be the walk in the park, never mind the meadow shown on the card. To take responsibility for how our most damaging impulses and fears show up in every aspect of our lives, we must first acknowledge their existence. Yikes! Accountability always takes moral courage; owning our vulnerabilities in a society built on exploitation requires real guts. Holding others accountable is equally tough, especially when we love them or when the behavior stems from addiction or mental health issues. Whichever side of the street you find yourself on, clean it up. 

Self-expression is tricky in a world built on oppression. We suppress aspects of ourselves because we learned, correctly or not, that expressing them leads to pain and danger. Strength asks us to reclaim the energy spent on repression to conquer shame and find communities where we shine most brilliantly. Where does authenticity feel sticky to you? Resist the urge to start yet another self-improvement project or rush to solve this problem via external means. First, allow yourself to feel the spaciousness and grace that come by frankly acknowledging the truth. 

Finally, notice that the Figure approaches the Lion fearlessly. Their relationship has a playful vibe. The Strength card reminds us that we all have an expressive power within us that exists apart from any shame or self-deception. Strength in this light looks like someone who has faced their fears with compassion, found a deep well of self-acceptance that will water all their flowering futures, and now stands ready to face the world. 

#### SHADOW ASPECTS
Or does the Figure grip the Lion’s jaws as a show of superiority and domination? People who “train” large cats in the real world create a power imbalance by controlling access to food, mixing affection with intimidation, and even pain. Abuse, violence, and head games inflict a condition of “learned helplessness.” Admit that you cheer a little when we hear about one of these cats mauling their captors. (It can’t be just us!)

Asserting dominance might feel amazing at the moment, but results in a lack of empathy that ultimately limits growth. In short, we see a dangerous emphasis on control that damages both parties as a critical shadow aspect of Strength. We can use this card to examine how this pattern might show up in your relationships.

First, a desire to demonstrate strength might lead to a mindset of overcoming challenges at any cost. This attitude could result in neglecting the well-being of yourself or other people to pursue “goals.” A deadly dog-eat-dog worldview might sneak into our thinking, allowing us to justify all manner of (self-) destructive actions. Next thing you know, this gentle Figure morphs into a latte-guzzling, over-scheduled Boss Bitch that scares the crap out of poor Lion. (It has its tail between its legs, come on!) Consider how ideologies like scarcity thinking, hustle culture, toxic positivity, or hyper-individualism might influence the situation or warp your perception.

Alternatively, we might put on a facade of strength to appear composed and resilient on the outside while struggling internally. This emotional armor causes difficulty in seeking support when needed. This card tells us not only do we need help, we deserve it! Others need and deserve the help we offer, too.
We often confuse self-criticism with self-discipline. Beating yourself up works in some cases or we wouldn’t do it, right? But the costs to our self-esteem and peace of mind can be staggering. Strength suggests that it’s time for a new strategy. Try incorporating self-compassion into your approach to a challenge. Trust that self-discipline can emerge from alignment and self-acceptance.

Love never seeks to control. All forms of domination or deception crush the spirit of awe and reverence that love requires. Yet a fear of losing love can make us feel the need to exert control in subtle ways. For example, we might hide parts of ourselves or start fibbing to manipulate how we’re perceived. If we suspect our partners have begun to grow away from us, we pressure them in similar ways. Some couples go on like this for decades! Will you?

Perhaps you notice another theme uniting Strength’s shadows: the capacity to endure what ought not to be endured.

On an individual level, we experience this shadow when we choose to suppress our feelings rather than deal with conflict openly. Misalignment causes profound distress yet we’d rather live with the pain than deal with the discomfort that acknowledging the issue provokes. We gaslight ourselves, do extra physical or affective labor, or make excuses for a toxic person or pattern– anything and everything to protect ourselves from having to make hard choices based on facts. Eventually, the situation explodes, fizzles out, or becomes our new normal. 

Collectively, this shadow strength shows up as political inertia. We vote for “the lesser of two evils” rather than organize ourselves to build another world that everyone assures us is possible. We spin our wheels on social media rather than show up in the real world, or any number of other behaviors that disconnect us from our collective strength. An absence of accountability, problems with consent, and cultural appropriation fall under this same umbrella. 

In its darkest, most hateful manifestation, this card means fascism. The word fascism comes from the Italian fascia, meaning a bundle of sticks bound together. A force that would break a single stick cannot break the bundle because together, they are stronger. It could have been a beautiful metaphor but they took it all the way to crap town.

The solution of course is to leave town, strip off our armor, and meet the Lion in an open field.
#### IN READINGS
Tarot practitioners commonly read the Strength card as an amplifier. Its presence emphasizes the influence of that placement and possibly the surrounding cards. When drawn as the signifier (often the first card of a spread) it suggests that the focus of the reading has profound meaning or potential power for the subject.   

Watch too for the appearance of Wands, especially the Queen of Wands. A fiery spread might indicate an extra charge (i.e., higher intensity or greater urgency) to the focus of the reading, especially when it pertains to creativity in some form.

Previous incarnations of the Tarot called this card “Force.” That word carries much more concentrated energy to us, implying a strong and tightly directed use of willpower. Consider if that term works better for this placement.

Lastly, this sunny archetype moonlights as a curse-breaker! Destructive interpersonal dynamics, ruts that feel impossible to escape, and compulsive behaviors of all sorts can be changed when Strength appears in a relevant placement.

Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,
You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)
You shall no longer take things at second or third-hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the specters in books,
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.
