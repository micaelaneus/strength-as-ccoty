## JOURNAL: STRENGTH IN YOUR NATAL SKY

Incorporating astrology is an easy and effective way to personalize how you work with aspects of Strength. You need your natal chart, which many online sources will calculate for free (see Resources and References).

Once you have it, note the signs and planets for 1) the house ruled by Leo, 2) the house hosting your Sun, 3) your Fifth house, and 4) your Eighth house.

Each of these houses connects to the themes, struggles, and opportunities of an area of your life. Unfortunately, we can’t go into each possible combination in this guide (cough, newsletter) so you’ll have to look them up yourself or find an experienced astrologer. Feel out how the house, its ruling astrological sign, and any planetary bodies influence one another to illuminate a core theme or field of interest.

*INSERT TABLE HERE*

Complete the following prompts for each of the combinations you listed in the table above, even your empty houses. But remember, this isn't a social studies test! Focus on the meanings that matter most to you rather than on getting the astrological definitions correct (whatever that is).

1. Look up the common associations for this house and write out its themes in your own words.
2. What astrological sign rules this house in your chart? Which of the sign’s themes resonate with you currently, or seem likely to take precedence soon?
3. Which planetary bodies occupy this house, and what do they signify?
4. Consider how your answers to the previous prompts intersect, and how they influence one another's expression. What themes, light or shadow, draw your attention? Trust that tickle of curiosity.
5. How do you manifest or explore those themes into your life, as practically as possible? Challenge yourself to find three ways to develop each of your most fascinating house-sign-planet combinations.

## Example: VENUS IN LEO IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE

Someone with Venus in their Eighth House (Transformations) should check in with their romantic life– history, current status, ideas about love, attachment style, the evolution of their sexual and gender identity, etc. They might see very literal changes to make, such as starting to date again or making some requests in the bedroom. More abstractly, they could focus on healing attachment issues.

A secondary area to explore is aesthetics, generally. This house encourages Venus-in-Leo to revamp their image (wardrobe, social media presence, etc.), refresh their home decor, or spend more time this year appreciating the arts. Fixed Fire inspires them to get an annual membership to the city ballet company.

To put the power of this placement into action, they decide to clean out their closet and every Friday (Venus's Day), they fill a vase with fresh flowers and branches to brighten their bedroom. They vow to meet all first dates at galleries or live performances rather than a bar or coffee shop.

## PRIORITIZE YOUR PLACEMENTS

The number of placements and therefore interpretations this exercise covers sometimes gets overwhelming, especially if you have a stellium in one or more houses. We have three pieces of advice to make it more manageable:

1. Let your intuition tell you which placements to focus on first. Use curiosity as a method to prioritize.
2. Analyze the placements featuring the Classical Planets before adding outer planets or asteroids.
3. Break up your analysis over the year! Your natal chart will never change, so you don't have a deadline.

If you want to join the newsletter, you could plan to interpret your placements as we go through the astrological seasons. Analyze the planets or houses related to each sign as we cover it in our mini-guides. Or use this method without joining, just find a way to escape the trap of perfectionism and keep having fun.
