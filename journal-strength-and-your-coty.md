# JOURNAL: Strength & Your Card of the Year

Now that you’ve chosen a Card of the Year (COTY), we can explore how it intersects with the core themes of the Strength archetype. Fish both your COTY and the Strength card out of your RWCS deck and grab your journal.

1. What relationship do you imagine these cards having with one another? Would they get along, get bored, or get in a fight? (Cards without a Figure still have personality, look at The Tower.)
2. Make note of any emotions or associations called up by the non-figurative imagery on these cards, no matter how inconsequential they seem. For instance, the lemniscates floating above The Magician and Strength might remind you of the boundless nature of cosmic time, or your sister’s ankle tattoo. Write them both down.
3. Which of Strength’s core themes or shadows have jumped out at you so far? We’re looking for the elements of this archetype that immediately make your intuition tingle. Do any aspects elicit curiosity, dread, or other notable emotion? Memories or associations?
4. How might the energy of your COTY amplify or add nuance to those themes? For instance, does Temperance highlight Strength’s forgiveness and equanimity? Think of your COTY as Strength’s wing-person, talking up their good points to a hottie. Now reverse the question: how does Strength hype your COTY?
5. Do you see places where these cards might have a bad influence on one another? Will your COTY exacerbate Strength’s tendency for egomania, for instance?
6. Look for ways your COTY could balance and support you when the hard parts of Strength show up in the coming year, and vice versa. Concentrate on the themes that jumped out at you earlier or resonate with your life currently.

Wrap up your journal exercise by choosing a little slogan or motto for the coming year that captures the spirit of your new team. You don’t need the world’s most poetic one-liner to get value here, so pick a phrase today and change it when lightning strikes.

## WHEN YOUR CARD OF THE YEAR IS STRENGTH

A double-Strength year, yay! Also, woof. Whatever happens, this year promises to transform you. You can use the same journal prompts listed above because haven’t you wondered what, um, meeting yourself would be like? Imagine overhearing the Figure talking to themselves or their fur-baby Lion.

We do have one additional prompt for double-Strengthies:

* Every archetype has an internal equilibrium, a yin-yang balance that generates wholeness. Match any shadow elements you wrote down in the previous question with a stabilizing quality that Strength also possesses. Counteract workaholism with the powerful sense of embodiment that this Figure radiates from head to toe, for instance, and put some playdates in your calendar to get yourself outside.

Finish by selecting one or more short mottos for the year as described above.
