# JOURNAL: STRONG STARTS

Now that we understand the core characteristics of this year's collective card, we can use them to prepare for the year ahead of us. Symbols from The Chariot card helped us reflect on 2023, and we modified that practice to set intentions for 2024 based on Strength's imagery. Refer back to the breakdowns given earlier in this section as you respond to the following prompts. Begin as you mean to continue: vulnerable, candid, fearless.

## THE LION'S JAWS

Fears, anxieties, and foreseeable challenges; practicalities inherent in modern life; things worth trusting, risks worth taking.

List out anticipated changes to your living situations, career, skillset, or other aspect of adult life. Note down major preoccupations or worries along with any work to be done (finish thesis, repair your roof, new garden). 

1. Developing a healthy relationship with the Lion is the main task faced by Strength. How will you nurture a loving relationship to whatever feels lion-y in your life?
2. Can you make each place you spend significant amounts of time in more comfortable and restorative for your body?
3. What we trust shapes our lives, and the beginning of trust is risk. What fresh forms do you want to take in 2024, and what's your ante?

## FLOWERS & WREATHS

Practices related to physical health and self-care; the fluid lifecycle, from seed to stump; partnerships, especially sexual or domestic.

Write down practices to support physical health and anticipated changes to your life or health, or those important to you (new births, retirement, leaving home).

1. What strategies do you have to maintain, possibly improve, your physical health? Emotional health?
2. How would you like to evolve your gender expression or sexual identity?
3. Which of your relationships give you the biggest opportunities to expand your capacity for connection?

## THE LEMNISCATE

Mental health; modes of communication or points of energetic exchange, including anything that streams or scrolls; spiritual practices and communities.

Name any supportive mental health practices you plan to start or continue this year. List all social media apps, streaming services, or other subscription content (newsletters, podcasts, YouTube channels) you regularly consume and put a star next to three of them.

1. How will you protect time and space for ritual practices (witchcraft, tarot, etc.) in the coming year?
2. What tools do you have to maintain and improve your mental health? Who are your helpers?
3. Do your boundaries look more like bridges or brick walls?

## THE WHITE ROBE

Initiations, tests, and thresholds; old hurts ready to heal; reflexive patterns and conditioning.

An initiation is any rite of passage we experience, formal or informal, that moves us into a new role or phase in life, or transforms us in fundamental sense. They often grant permission for us to enter places, access tools, or participate in activities previously out-of-bounds.

1. Peeking over your shoulder, into your past: what initiations have you experienced over the course of your life?
2. What initiatons do see in the years ahead, beginning with 2024?
3. Name a pattern (not a "bad habit" but a repeating behavior) in your life that you feel ready to outgrow, disrupt, or renegotiate. Name one you want to reinforce through continued repetition.
