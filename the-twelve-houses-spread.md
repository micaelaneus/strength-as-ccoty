# TAROT: The Twelve Houses Spread

Zodiac spreads take us on a journey from our innermost selves in the First House, through the houses governing our relationships and careers, until arriving in the mysterious Twelfth House. Since each house corresponds to a sign, this spread takes us through a complete astrological year starting with Aries in March. Use the Twelve Houses to get a sense of how you stand and decide where to go deeper in the coming year.

## BEFORE YOU BEGIN

This spread is complex, not gonna lie. Reading it gets both easier and richer the more you understand astrology and your natal chart, and puzzling through this spread is one way to build that expertise. Hang in there.

Zodiac spreads have moments when they feel most helpful. First, the start of a new year in whatever calendars you use (Gregorian, lunar, Jewish, etc.) as well as at the spring equinox (aka the astrological new year) and your birthday. Secondly, any other time you experience a major reset event such as a big move, change in your relationship status, career shift, etc.

We do not recommend zodiac spreads at the birth/adoption of a child *when done for the child.* Tarot readings generally cannot be done without the consent and participation of one key subject, anyway, and this spread isn’t meant to deliver lifelong predictions. (Get a natal chart analysis instead.) This spread is better used by the new parent to get insight into this period of their own lives.

Lastly, we fully encourage you to riff on the prompts below to match any question you have for that house. For instance, someone who recently “came out” (in any sense of the phrase) may have a very clear concern to explore in their First House. We preferred to give a cluster of questions rather than an explicit label for the card placements so your intuition has room to wiggle. Answer the question that feels most resonant to you, or write your own.

## READING THE TWELVE HOUSES

If your practice contains a ritual opener such as casting a circle or calling in guides, perform it now. Take a moment to center yourself with a few deep breaths and settle into your body. Articulate your query mentally or in writing to strengthen and focus your intention.

When you feel ready, shuffle and cut the cards. Place all twelve cards face down, starting at the First House and moving counter-clockwise to pull a card for each successive house up to the Twelfth. Placing all cards face-up at once will overwhelm your reading, believe! Lay out the complete map and then take the journey one step at a time.

Before you reveal each card, read the prompts and marinate for a moment. Then turn the card over to make your interpretation before moving to the next house. We recommend brief journaling both before and after you flip each card.

### CARD 1 - FIRST HOUSE OF IDENTITIES - ASCENDANT

What area of personal growth would most benefit from attention now? Where do I need to cultivate more self-confidence, or express myself with greater authenticity? How do I need to change, perhaps dramatically?

### CARD 2 - SECOND HOUSE OF PRACTICALITIES

How am I supported, and where do I lack support? What aspect of my life deserves more pleasure and ease? Where does stubbornness or stale belief hold me back from achievement and growth? Am I too attached?

### CARD 3 - THIRD HOUSE OF COMMUNION

Do my friendships and community serve my highest self? Do I serve theirs? How do my communication patterns impact my relationships? Where do I step up, or maybe step back, in collaborations? Am I in love?

### CARD 4 - FOURTH HOUSE OF BELONGING - IMUM COELI (IC)

An emotional vibe check. How am I doing, in the most holistic sense imaginable? Is my “home” stable, meaning both practically secure (finances, agreements) and well-regulated (low drama, cheery)?

### CARD 5 - FIFTH HOUSE OF CREATIVITIES

Where and when do my unique gifts shine? How confident do I feel sharing myself, authentically? Does my creativity get enough attention? Should I take the next step in a project? What am I so afraid of?

### CARD 6 - SIXTH HOUSE OF EMBODIMENTS

Do my habits support my physical and mental health? How healthy do I feel, regardless of what a doctor might say? What energy or practice will help me enjoy my body more fully? Where can I release perfectionism?

### CARD 7 - SEVENTH HOUSE OF PARTNERSHIPS - DESCENDANT

Do I form trustworthy partnerships? How well do my boundaries serve my well-being? What area of my life faces conflict, and therefore offers growth? Where can I better show up for community? Where do I have more to offer the folks in my intimate life?

### CARD 8 - EIGHTH HOUSE OF TRANSFORMATIONS

What pattern can I release? What energy do I need to call in or let flow out of me? Where has my rigidity or desire for control hurt me or others? How have I grown in the period of my life now ending? How’s my sex life?

### CARD 9 - NINTH HOUSE OF PHILOSOPHIES

Do my actions align with my ethics? How open am I (or should I be) for experiences that expand my perspective like travel, education, discomfort? Am I in a rut? Or is this a season for trust? What can I teach others?

### CARD 10 - TENTH HOUSE OF LEGACIES - MEDIUM COELI (MC) OR MIDHEAVEN

Have I honored my responsibilities? What area of my life merits more discipline, and which needs less compulsive fixation? Do I set and keep meaningful goals appropriately? Where should I lighten up? Or maybe buckle down?

### CARD 11 - ELEVENTH HOUSE OF COLLABORATORS

Vast communities hold and nurture us– societies and ecologies, internal and ancestral. How well do I treat my collaborators? What’s one aspect that deserves extra appreciation? How can I improve my communal presence?

### CARD 12 - TWELFTH HOUSE OF MYSTERIES

Dreams, fantasies, wishes, regrets, inner voices, and callings. What intuitive aspect of my life has the greatest power over me now? Do I need to manifest this energy, or release it? Where can I let intuition guide me more outrageously?

## INTERPRETING THE SPREAD

Do a vibe check on the groupings and placements discussed below. Look for associated Major Arcana cards, a preponderance of cards from the same suit, your Card of the Year (see the following section), and of course Strength. Does this add nuance or noise? Your gut will tell you.

### HOUSE GROUPINGS

Dividing the sky into twelve parts creates a symmetry to explore for even more insight. Houses that oppose or mirror one another form subgroups with their particular significance:

* Angular Houses (1, 4, 7, 10) represent areas to take initiative and embrace greater prominence.
* Succedent Houses (2, 5, 8, 11) show us places to trust for stability and support when we focus.
* Cadent Houses (3, 6, 9, 12) imply fluidity. Here, we benefit from adaptivity and cooperation.

### THE ANGLES

We indicated where the Ascendant, Descendant, Imum Coeli (IC), and Medium Coeli (MC) sit in the spread because they too carry unique significance that may enhance your reading:

* The Ascendant reflects your point of view, whether conscious or unconscious.
* The IC might indicate an energy/resource/relationship that is a stabilizing foundation or entrenched pattern.
* The Descendant highlights the influence of (or impact on) your relationship/s.
* The MC emphasizes the power of legacies (inheritances we receive or bestow, reputations, etc.)

### OPPOSING HOUSES

Astrologers offer one further grouping to consider, the opposing house pairs:

* Identity and Ally (Houses 1 and 7) connect a part of yourself with a supporter.
* Cause and Effect (Houses 2 and 8) show the ripple effects of your choices.
* Friends and High Places (Houses 3 and 9) identify connections and how they shape your opportunities.
* Intention and Impact (Houses 4 and 10), aka “how it started” and “how it's going”
* Spark and Bellows (Houses 5 and 11) illuminate your creative spark and who/what fans its flames.
* Body and Soul (Houses 6 and 12) unite your embodied self and inner realms.

Calling these houses *opposing* implies antagonism and contradiction; we prefer to call them *complementing.* They’re more dynamic duo than arch-enemies and hey, sometimes couples fight! That doesn’t mean they don’t love you.
