# JOURNAL: The Chariot Rides On

Contrary to the cliche, we don’t learn from experience— we learn by reflecting on experience. This journal exercise allows you to review the year through the lens of The Chariot, the collective card of the year in 2023, even if you did not consciously work with the archetype during the last twelve months.

The Chariot brings up diligence, mastery, and action as essential skills of the adept. The Driver shown on this card feels sexy, not romantic or flirty, largely due to their aura of self-confidence. They link hard-earned expertise with intuition and passion (represented by the two sphinxes pulling the cart) to form a highly charismatic force that others find irresistible. This archetype is about knowing our self-worth and making bold moves. Its shadow covers excess ambition, burnout, and impulsiveness.

We based the following prompts on symbols on this card to reveal how The Chariot rode through your life in 2023. For each prompt, list out the events or insights that occurred in that area of your life and then summarize your takeaways using the questions as inspiration.

## THE DRIVER

*Intellect, skills or technical expertise; responsibility and decision-making; willpower.*

Recall any world events that affected you, plus matters of adulting such as changes in living situations, career moves, or creative projects. Also, note any practical skills learned or developed, like renewing your CPR certification.

1. How did you feel about your material conditions? Home, career, political situation, etc.

2. Where did you struggle and where did you thrive?

3. Which obstacles that you faced required adaptation to overcome? Which took raw willpower? What other strategies did you try last year?

## THE HORSES / SPHINXES

*Instinct and the unconscious mind; passion and personal preferences; the embodied self.*

Write down any shifts in relationships, deaths or births, health updates, physical self-care habits, and the most memorable highs and lows.

1. What allies (human or otherwise) supported you this year? Did you thank them?

2. How did you support your emotional and physical well-being, and what challenged you?

3. Where did you mess up, and how did you make amends?

## THE STAR CROWN

*Authenticity and enlightened altruism; psychic growth, intuition, mystery; trust issues.*

Getting more esoteric, name any emotional or spiritual breakthroughs, mental health therapies, or psychological self-care. List communication skills you learned or developed, like Nonviolent Communication or boundary-setting.

1. Did you have a ritual practice like witchcraft or tarot? If so, how well did it serve you? If not, why not? Did you miss it, or never consider it before?

2. What non-witchcraft practices (therapy, meds, long walks with a friend, self-help books, recovery groups, etc.) supported your emotional and psychological well-being?

3. How well did your actions align with your values? Do a vibe check, not a shame spiral.

## THE WHEEL

*Places of effort and over-coming; obstructed energies or desires; momentum and inertia.*

Take a deep breath and remember points when exasperation, rage, or protective apathy took over. Track numbing or dissociative methods, plus the ruts and re-runs you fell into over the year.

1. What crushed me? How do I feel about how I took care of myself after?

2. Did any of my shadow-selves make untimely appearances or overstay their welcome?

3. How and when did I check out?

When you finish, copy items from these prompts that you’d like to release onto bits of paper for use in *The Lion's Remedy Ritual.*

Now that we've reviewed 2023 through the eyes of The Chariot, let's take a closer look at Strength as the archetype for the year ahead. We'll take a deep dive into the card's symbols and interpretation in the next section before learning how to activate them through ritual and astrology later in the guide.
