# JOURNAL: The Chariot Rides On

Contrary to the cliche, we don’t learn from experience— we learn by reflecting on experience. Use these journal prompts to review last year, which fell under the archetype of The Chariot, before moving into our Strength year.

The Chariot card calls up themes of diligence, mastery, and action. The Driver shown on this card feels irresistibly sexy rather than romantic, largely due to their aura of self-confidence. They have linked their hard-earned expertise with the power of intuition and passion, represented by the two sphinxes. This archetype is about knowing our self-worth and making bold moves. Its shadow covers excess ambition, burnout, and impulsiveness. 

We wrote journal prompts inspired by symbols on this card to help you reflect on how The Chariot appeared in your life in 2023. For each, you’ll first list events or insights that occurred in that area of your life, then write about whatever comes up. 

**THE DRIVER**
Recall any world events that affected you, plus adult stuff such as changes in living situations, career moves, or creative projects. Also, note any practical skills learned or developed, like renewing your CPR certification. How did you feel about your material conditions? Where did you struggle and where did you thrive? How did you adapt?

**THE HORSES / SPHINXES**
Write down any shifts in relationships, deaths or births, health updates, physical self-care habits, and the most memorable highs and lows. What allies (human or otherwise) supported you this year? Have you thanked them, or maybe given them honest feedback?

**THE STAR CROWN**
Getting more esoteric, name any emotional or spiritual breakthroughs, mental health therapies, or psychological self-care. List communication skills learned or developed, like Nonviolent Communication or boundary setting. Did your ritual practice (witchcraft, magic) and other means of tending your inner garden serve you? How well did your actions align with your values? Do a vibe check.

**THE WHEEL**
Take a deep breath and remember points when exasperation, rage, or protective apathy took over. Track numbing or dissociative methods, plus the ruts and re-runs. What crushed me, and how do I feel about how I took care of myself after? How and when did I check out?

Optional: copy items from these prompts that you’d like to release onto bits of paper for use in The Lion's Remedy Ritual.
