# PART III: ASTROLOGY

The stars do not map out our lives; they only show us the edges of our comfort zones. Astrology should put us in touch with our limits and motivate us to test them, joyfully and compassionately, as acts of cosmic self-love. We envision your life as a luminous jewel spinning in space, every facet a wonder to behold, and hope this work inspires you to go star-gazing with us.

## THE SUN & LEO

As the eighth card in the Major Arcana, the Strength card aligns with the Eighth House and is ruled by Leo and the Sun. (The RWCS creators moved this card from its prior position as the eleventh card for this reason.) Creativity, fruitful labor, and charisma get a boost from the collective power of these elements. The Sun urges us to express ourselves candidly, sharing our brilliance with others confidently. Leo takes passion to a higher level, giving us an unparalleled ability to attract others to our flames. This combo benefits artists of all mediums, and other professions may also get a beneficial bump of success and recognition. The generosity shown in this period has an exceptional power to do good, whether giving material resources or immaterial benefits like second chances.

This pairing rewards boldness but cautions against overreaching; egomania, workaholism, and pushiness must be curbed. All matters of the Eighth House merit consideration during this period, and they do get tricksy! This house relates to transformations, gray areas, and energetic exchanges, which can be tough to navigate. On the other hand, it makes this year a fantastic time to shake up any patterns you’re tired of reliving.

## FIRE & THE SUIT OF WANDS

Leo brings the element of Fire to Strength, tying this card to the Suit of Wands. Fire and Wands share a vigorous energy associated with intuition, craftsmanship, and grassroots political action. Our instinct to challenge ourselves to grow creatively or to break destructive patterns gets a boost from their cooperative energies. Unfortunately, sparks start wildfires when left unchecked. Watch out for ambition for its own sake, snark, and a certain impulsive selfishness.

Three of the twelve astrological signs have the element of Fire, each in one of the three modalities (Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable). Modalities add nuance to how that element operates in that sign. Leo’s Fire is Fixed, meaning the most mature and stabilizing expression of its influence. It beats out a steady rhythm for Strength to play over, making this year's endeavors notable for their durability and trustworthiness. Fixed Fire’s shadow qualities relate to excessive inertia, making us slow to evolve or compromise when needed.

## STRENGTH IN YOUR NATAL SKY

Incorporating astrology is an easy and effective way to personalize how you work with aspects of Strength. You’ll need your natal chart, which many online sources will calculate for free (see Resources and References). Once you have it, note the signs and planets for 1) your Eighth House, 2) the house ruled by Leo, and 3) the house hosting your Sun.

Each of these houses relates to the themes, struggles, and opportunities of an area of your life. Unfortunately, we can’t go into each possible placement in this guide (cough, newsletter) so you’ll have to look them up yourself or find an experienced astrologer. When you get a sense of the house meanings, take inventory of those aspects of your life both externally (as they manifest to others) or internally (as beliefs, shadows, or self-talk patterns). Feel out how the house, its ruling astrological sign, and any planetary bodies influence one another, intuitively.

### Example: VENUS IN LEO IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE

Someone with Venus in their House of Transformations should check in with their romantic life– history, current status, ideas about love, attachment style, the evolution of their sexual and gender identity, etc. They might see very literal changes to make such as starting to date again or making some requests in the bedroom. 
More abstractly, they could focus on healing attachment issues. 

A secondary area to explore is aesthetics, generally. Strength invites Venus-in-Leo to revamp their image (wardrobe, social media presence, etc.), refresh their home decor, or simply spend more time this year appreciating the arts. 

To put the power of this placement into action, they decide to clean out their closet and meet all first dates at galleries or live performances rather than a bar or coffee shop.
