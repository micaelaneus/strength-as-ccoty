RITUAL
THE lIOnS REMeDY

In the Lion’s roar, we hear an undeniable message: you’ve got to feel it to heal it, and the only way out is through. Staying present with difficult emotions is a critical step in any healing process and it inspires this ritual. We begin and end with journaling before embarking on a visualization journey to Strength’s meadow. Along the way, we do a simple banishing/releasing practice and cure a Lion of mystical indigestion.

MATERIALS
Journal
Small scraps of paper
Candle and burn bowl
Other ritual elements such as incense, stone allies, etc.
Optional: notes from The Chariot Rides On for the releasing practice

Any fire-safe container not used for food prep can become a burn bowl for the releasing practice. Fireplaces, compost bins, or even toilets work as substitutes. Insert the element that matches your method wherever we invoke fire, like “earth” for composting or “water” for flushing. (Think carefully before adding paper to waterways, though.)

OPEN A RITUAL SPACE

Take some breaths to build focus, calm the mind, and signal to your body that you are entering a different state of being. Sit quietly until you feel centered before continuing. If you have a method for casting a circle in your practice, perform it here.

Announce your reason for performing the ritual and dedicate the merits:

“I gather here to [your purpose or a general desire], and I dedicate any merits of my work to the highest good of all beings [or name a recipient].”

Prepare your tarot cards and other materials, especially the scrap papers for the releasing ritual. When you're ready, take a comfortable seat and go through the following visualization.

VISUALIZATION: FINDING THE LION’S REMEDY
You find yourself standing in the center of town having One of Those Days. Traffic is terrible, people are awful, and you can smell your own armpits. Sink into your senses. Connect with the tension of modern life as you imagine yourself sitting on the street, maybe at a bus stop bench or outdoor cafe table. Behind you, you overhear a group of people gossiping about someone they can barely tolerate— it’s you! They’re shredding you apart and having a good laugh.

Write down what those jerks say about you: every self-criticism, negative thought, stressor, point of tension, etc. on scraps of paper.

You’ve heard enough and feel quite sick of them, this place, and the entire day. Gather your things into a bag and walk out of the town with a determination to salvage your afternoon. Walk until you find yourself in a thick forest, so thick you’re pushing tree branches out of your way. They may snap back to whip your face, and you might stumble over rotting logs. Luckily the forest absorbs and muffles all sounds coming from town, leaving only birdsong. Go ahead and sigh with relief. The ground gets rockier and the air colder— you’re headed up the side of a mountain.

Keep walking until the slope decreases and you know you have passed the peak. Now a dense forest and a tall mountain lay between you and your troubles. Keep walking until the trees thin out and the forest opens into a wide meadow. The earth lies even under your feet, neither compacted nor marshy, and smells profoundly alive. Freed from the constricting density of the forest, you feel a gentle wind on your cheeks. Open your arms wide to embrace this openness.  

You roam about the meadow looking for dragonflies or quails but you don’t see any. Instead, at the center of the field, you meet eyes with a Lion. It locks you into the unblinking, all-knowing power stare that cats learn from the Moon. You will have to face it.

Time stops, yet many moments pass. The Lion only looks at you, neither blinking nor moving, and slowly you realize it’s in some kind of distress. An irresistible urge to touch the Lion takes command of your body and you begin a slow approach. 

When you reach it, you can tell it’s in an enormous, absolutely soul-crushing amount of pain. You reach out to comfort it, feeling the warmth of its body in the sunlight as you caress it around the ears. You pick a few small burs out of its coat and feel the nubby line of an old scar under its mane. The Lion melts in the face of your compassion, rubbing its face into your hands for more love.

You instinctively know that the Lion’s remedy lies within its mouth, and therefore you must open the Lion’s jaws. It offers no resistance as you gently work your hands over its muzzle. It willingly cooperates by opening wider and flopping out its tongue. You feel its hot breath on your knuckles and its saliva over your wrist as you reach down its throat.

You reach so deeply into its guts that you feel one of its front teeth dig into your armpit. At that moment, your fingers brush against something the Lion obviously should not have swallowed. Somehow you find a way to reach one more inch so your hand can close around the object. Grasp it firmly and gently tug until the Lion’s gut releases it. Hold on to it as you carefully maneuver your arm out from inside the Lion.
Relieved of this pain and seemingly happy to let you keep the object, the Lion gives you one last sign of its affection and gratitude before happily bounding away. As it disappears into the taller grasses, you examine the recovered object and instantly recognize that it's enchanted with powerful magic. You know that it will help you overcome any obstacle and silence the haters back in town.

You found the Lion’s Remedy. What does this object look like, and what powers does it give you?  

Wipe the Lion’s spit off your new totem. You’re bringing this home with you, no question. Unfortunately, all the things you stuffed into your bag back in town mean you don’t have the space to carry it. You decide to empty your bag of anything non-essential.

Gather the scraps of paper from the first step of the ritual and prepare your method for releasing them; we use a candle and burn bowl.
One by one, lift each scrap in your right hand and recite a one-line banishing spell as you carefully set it aflame. If you wish to read it or name what you’re releasing (very optional), use only the shortest description possible. Retelling the story will re-activate those neural pathways just when we want that pattern to fade away, so briefer is better.
Examples of one-line banishing spells, presented in order of increasing intensity:
By fire, I return this energy [or brief description] to its source. May it flow to the place where it does the most good— it’s no longer needed here.
By the power of fire, I surrender and release you, ending all attachments. May you go to serve life in a new form, in a new place.
By fire, I banish you. For my highest good, I banish you. To serve life [or a specific cause], I banish you.
I cast you out. I no longer desire your presence in my life, your energy is unwelcome, and so you must go. By fire, I burn and banish you. Do not return.
With this flame and by my will, I reclaim all power from you. From this moment until the end of time, I am safe from your control. This fire has cleansed my life of your influence, and I am free. [At “power”, name anything you want to call back like dignity, financial freedom, or romantic longing.]
When you finish releasing every bit of old baggage, close out this portion of the ritual by speaking a version of the following phrase:
May this flame find and release any negative energy, attachment, or influence not yet named which does me harm, for my good and the good of all beings.
Use incense, smudging herbs, or essential oils to clear the air. Peeling citrus and adding the rinds to hot water works as well, and so does simply opening a window. If using a dedicated banishing-protecting candle (often black), extinguish it. Leave your ritual candle burning.

Now that you’ve cleaned out your bag, you find the enchanted Lion's Remedy fits perfectly, and carrying it is no trouble. Content with your adventure, you pause for a moment to soak in the delicious power of the meadow before heading back toward the mountain to home.

CLOSE THE RITUAL SPACE

Reflect on your journey to the meadow:

Did you recognize any of the phantom townspeople from real life? 
Consider what meanings and associations the Lion’s Remedy token evokes in your imagination. Why did you find this object, as opposed to some other?
How did you feel after cleaning out your purse?

Taking all these ideas into consideration, set an intention for the next few months. Good intentions capture processes and actions within our control whereas a goal focuses on outcomes, which we may not control. Write down what you desire and what action/s you will perform to manifest it in one clear sentence. 

“I’m going to get a job.” From where? A vending machine?

“I will end this period of financial hardship by finding three ways to broaden my job search, canceling my avocado toast subscription, and getting Luisa to critique my resume.” Gotcha!

When your reflection feels complete, close your circle according to your practice or simply say something like:

“May all helpers gathered here go in peace with my gratitude, and may the work done here be for the good of all. So concludes my ritual.”

THE LION’S REMEDY IN THE OPEN CIRCLE

We have three ideas for extending this ritual into everyday life. Choose one or more that match your style, or create your own:

For the next eight days, read or speak your intention aloud to yourself as you perform an everyday act of self-care. Stick a piece of paper with your intention written on it between the bristles of your hairbrush to recite into the mirror as you brush your hair. Enchant your lip gloss, moisturizer, or inhaler— anything you use at least once per day and relates to self-care which reminds you to recite your intention.
Keep a tangible incarnation of your Lion’s Remedy totem near you for the next eight days or the duration of your intention. Translate more fantastical totems that don’t fit in your pocket into an everyday item that loosely correlates. A hot air balloon might turn into a portable heater or bolt cutters into kitchen shears, for instance.
Want your magic to last? Solidarity is forever! Take time to support a collective effort related to the fears and obstacles you banished with the Lion’s Remedy. For instance, someone who cleansed a bad relationship might volunteer at (or donate to) a local shelter for domestic abuse survivors. Feel like your job or living situation is a prison? Help others escape incarceration by contributing to the National Bail-Out. Picking up litter would work for any issue— bless some work gloves with your intention and fill a bag at your local beach or park.

Now that we have a strong foundation for connecting with the Strength, we can personalize how we work with this archetype by incorporating astrology. Make sure you have your natal chart handy.
