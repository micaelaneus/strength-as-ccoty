# JOURNAL: Ever Stronger Strengths

* change the name, Mica. Seriously, it's not about the font

Work through the relevant aspects of your natal chart, starting with the three houses associated with Strength and referring to our Venus-in-Leo example above. But this isn't a social studies test! Focus on the meanings that matter most to you rather than on getting the astrological definitions correct (whatever that is).

* We offer an example: Venus in Leo in the Eighth House

1. Look up the common associations for this house and write out its themes in your own words.

* The Eighth House is (these things)
* romantic life– history, current status, ideas about love, attachment style, the evolution of their sexual and gender identity, etc.

2. What astrological sign rules this house in your chart? Which of the sign’s themes resonate with you currently, or seem likely to take precedence soon?

* Leo, and these themes seem cool

3. Which planetary bodies occupy this house, and what do they signify? (See our note on "empty houses" below.)

* Venus, which means (stuff)

4. Consider how your answers to the previous prompts intersect, and how they influence one another's expression. What themes, light or shadow, draw your attention? Trust that tickle of curiosity.

* They might see very literal changes to make such as starting to date again or making some requests in the bedroom.More abstractly, they could focus on healing attachment issues.
* A secondary area to explore is aesthetics, generally. Strength invites Venus-in-Leo to revamp their image (wardrobe, social media presence, etc.), refresh their home decor, or simply spend more time this year appreciating the arts.

5. How do you manifest or explore those themes into your life, as practically as possible? Challenge yourself to find three ways to develop each of your most fascinating house-sign-planet combinations.

* To put the power of this placement into action, they decide to clean out their closet and meet all first dates at galleries or live performances rather than a bar or coffee shop.

## Example: VENUS IN LEO IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE

Someone with Venus in their House of Transformations should check in with their romantic life– history, current status, ideas about love, attachment style, the evolution of their sexual and gender identity, etc. They might see very literal changes to make such as starting to date again or making some requests in the bedroom. 
More abstractly, they could focus on healing attachment issues.
