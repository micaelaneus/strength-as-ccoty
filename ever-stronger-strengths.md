# JOURNAL: Ever Stronger Strengths

We don’t believe in “bad” astrological placements any more than we believe in bad cards. Everything we observe in the cards or the sky shows us how to grow wiser and stronger even when they point out areas to improve. You may or may not like what you see in your chart; either way, you'll know where to focus your intentions in the coming year. It's a chance to evaluate your strengths and grow even stronger.

Work through the relevant aspects of your natal chart, starting with the three houses associated with Strength and referring to our Venus-in-Leo example above. But this isn't a social studies test! Focus on the meanings that matter most to you rather than on getting the astrological definitions correct (whatever that is).

1. Look up the common associations for this house and write out its themes in your own words.
2. What astrological sign rules this house in your chart? Which of the sign’s themes resonate with you currently, or seem likely to take precedence soon?
3. Which planetary bodies occupy this house, and what do they signify? (See our note on "empty houses" below.)
4. Consider how your answers to the previous prompts intersect, and how they influence one another's expression. What themes, light or shadow, draw your attention? Trust that tickle of curiosity.
5. How do you manifest or explore those themes into your life, as practically as possible? Challenge yourself to find three ways to develop each of your most fascinating house-sign-planet combinations. 

A house devoid of any planetary bodies does not foretell doom or deprivation in that area of your life. So-called "empty houses" signify that you have less struggle or drama in that area, which means those topics will not provide you the most motivation for growth. An empty house does not guarantee that you will never face difficulty, of course, only that your thorniest challenges lie elsewhere in the chart.
