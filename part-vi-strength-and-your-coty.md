# PART IV: Your Card of the Year

Just as we share Strength as our Collective Card of the Year, we each have an archetype from the Major Arcana that serves as a personal Card of the Year (COTY). Working with collective and personal cards separately and as a complementing pair gives us more opportunities for growth while still providing some structure. Finding your COTY is the first step.

## SELECT AN ARCHETYPE FOR 2024

Add up the digits of the month and date of your birthday with the current year. If the total is greater than 21, reduce by adding the digits again. The final sum corresponds to a card in the Major Arcana and will be your Card of the Year (COTY).

You might get two different cards based on how you add the numbers. Pamela Coleman Smith, who illustrated the tarot deck, was born on February 16th, 1878. She might calculate her card in 2024 like 16 + 2 + 2024 = 2042 = 2 + 0 + 4 + 2 = 8 (Strength) or 1 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 17 (The Star). Since 17 < 21, she could decide not to reduce any further. For numbers > 22, reduce again.

Why 22, when 21 (The World) is the highest card? The Major Arcana begins at card 0 with The Fool and it’s not possible for a date to ever add up to zero– that’s subtraction! (#mathwhiz) Many folks, we included, use 22 to indicate a year of The Fool to adjust for this oddity.

Or don’t do any arithmetic and go with your gut. Maybe you spent last year dancing with The Devil (15), not playing games with The Magician (1) as promised by the math method. You may decide to work with The High Priestess (2) in 2024, or spend some time in The Sun (19). Make the choice that feels right and remember– you can’t break the rules because there aren’t any.

One word of caution: beware of wishful thinking. You may want to go clubbing with The Lovers (6) without first getting bounced by The Hierophant (5), but growth rarely happens that way. Feeling a little apprehensive or disoriented might mean that this is exactly where you need to put in the work. Psychologists call this “resistance”. Only you can say for sure, so take an honest look at your motivations before choosing.
