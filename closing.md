# Closing

Like many of you, we come to the end of 2023 steeped in grief and simmering with rage. Tremendous loss in our own lives, chief among them the death of Leigh Clare from cancer at Samhain, along with an ever-lengthening list of global atrocities has made this past year a real doozy. 

Truthfully, we wrote this guide for ourselves. A sense of dread started to poison our days, and the only reliable antidote was radical witchcraft. The courage and conviction of the Strength archetype has arrived in the nick of time, in our opinion, and weâ€™re ready to roll up our sleeves. We hope the material presented here gives you some tools to work with this card for the highest good, too.

Many thanks to Anandi Worden, Sean Bonnette, and Ted Mills for their support and feedback on the ideation stage and early drafts. Friendship is the best magic, truly.

We want to thank our tarot buddy, Erin Kenny, for the many ways she affirmed and encouraged us over the last year. We were introduced virtually by Amanda Yates Garcia, the Oracle of LA, whose teachings heavily influenced this guide. Join her *Mystery Cult*, buy her books, and listen to the *Between the Worlds Podcast*.

Lastly, we want to thank everyone who shows the eff up and will continue to stand by our side in 2024.
