# PART III: ASTROLOGY

The stars do not map out our lives; they only show us the edges of our comfort zones. Astrology should put us in touch with our limits and motivate us to test them, joyfully and compassionately, as acts of cosmic self-love. We envision your life as a luminous jewel spinning in space, every facet a wonder to behold, and hope this work inspires you to go star-gazing with us.

As with tarot and ritual, many approaches to astrology exist and we again align ourselves with the mythopoetic and ecology-based schools of thought. Our use of natal charts and annual transits emphasizes potentialities over predictions, and we see the zodiac as another source of archetypal inspiration.

We don’t believe in “bad” astrological placements any more than we believe in bad cards. Everything observed in the cards or the sky shows us how to grow wiser and stronger even when they point out areas to improve. You may or may not like what you see in your chart; either way, you'll know where to focus your efforts in the coming year.

More technically, this guidebook uses Tropical (aka Western) astrology with Whole Sign Placements to calculate natal charts. We went with Whole Signs rather than the more common method, Placidus, because the charts look less intimidating. A simpler chart makes introducing the zodiac into your tarot practice more inviting, in our opinion. Other methods of determining houses do not conflict with our material as far as we see, so create your chart using the method you prefer. 

The most archaic roots of astrology remain buried and a teensy bit tangled in the archeological record, to put it mildly. Researchers agree that ancient astrologers connected the stars to the seasons and used their observations to advise their communities in the practical matters of life. They inhabited a living planet surrounded and sustained by awe-inspiring forces, not a resource-rich but ultimately insensate rock described in European thought.

Astrological storytelling was one of many tools they used to make choices in uncertain times shaped by incomprehensible forces, not unlike what we do today. They wanted people to feel less afraid and more awe-struck as they wound their way through the labyrinth of life. We humbly place ourselves in this lineage.

UNDERSTANDING PLACEMENTS

At the heart of every astrological interpretation lies the idea of placement: the confluence of a planet, a zodiac sign, and a house that creates a unit of meaning. When someone says "I'm a Scorpio Rising", they mean that the Sun was in the sign of Scorpio in the First House (the one "rising" on the horizon) at the moment of their birth. Folks generally use that pattern to talk about placements: a planet in a sign in a house. 

Placements provide the basis for most of the ways we interpret charts and transits, the two categories of astrological readings. Charts describe the position of the sky at a moment in time, like a snapshot, whereas transits refer to movements (animated gifs) like a planet moving between houses.

Natal chart will break down any aspects and patterns found in your sky, though we don't use them in this guidebook. An aspect (trine, conjunction, quincunx, etc.) refers to the angle between placements, and a pattern (e.g., Grand Trine, Yod) refers to collections of aspects that generate compound placements. Think of them as meta-aspects, or placements-of-placements.

THE PLANETS
We use the word planet to refer to any of the orbiting bodies with metaphysical significance in astrology: 
The Classical ( or Personal) Planets: The Sun, Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn
The Modern (or Outer, or Impersonal) Planets: Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto
The Asteroids: Juno, Ceres, Pallas, Eros, and most notably, Chiron

Each planet represents instinctual urges and subconscious motivations, the essential energies that animate our lives. Venus corresponds to sexual and romantic desires, for instance, and so its placement in your natal chart hints at how you express yourself in affairs of the heart and, sometimes, the crotch.

We recommend leaving asteroids other than Chiron out of your initial readings until getting a clear view of the big picture.

THE SIGNS

The zodiac refers to the movement of the Sun through the ecliptic plane over a year, divided into twelve portions called signs. Each sign conveys an aura or mood that colors how elements under it express themselves. Someone with Venus-in-Leo might flirt by sneaking a (consensual) pinch of your buttcheek, whereas someone with Venus-in-Virgo might set the mood by emptying the dishwasher. (You'll understand when you're older.)

Signs of the zodiac follow a predetermined order that begins and ends at the equinox in March and last approximately thirty days. This duration has nothing to do with lunar months (~28 days), though they often fit together nicely because of their similar cycle lengths. 

A full moon happens in the sign opposing the season, e.g., Capricorn season has a full moon in Cancer.

THE HOUSES
The twelve sections of the sky that make the zodiac also form twelve houses, each linked to core areas of life experiences (families, careers, romance, etc.). The planet and sign pairing hints at the energy coming our way, and the house tells us where in our lives it will land. Houses have fuzzy edges, however. Working out their boundaries for yourself works better than any dogmatic definition, and The Twelve Houses Spread has our take on them to get you started.

A house devoid of any planetary bodies does not foretell doom or deprivation in that area of your life. So-called empty houses signify that you face less struggle or drama in that area, but they do not say why. The same goes for stellium (houses crowded with four or more planets), which may signify anything from a party or a street brawl. Analyze the aspects and signs to get more information before picking out your shoes. 

ELEMENTS & MODALITIES
Signs have associated alchemical elements: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. Every element relates to three of the twelve astrological signs, each in one of the three modalities (Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable). Modalities add nuance to how that element operates in that sign, not unlike how a sign influences the expression of a planet.

POLARITY
We do not add polarity to signs or houses because we have yet to find a binary without too much baggage. We mention them because you will encounter many versions in other astrological sources: masculine-feminine, yin-yang, light-dark, active-passive, positive-negative, etc.

THE ASTROLOGICAL CORRESPONDENCES OF THE STRENGTH ARCHETYPE

THE SUN & LEO

The prominent role of the Lion on the Strength card links it to the Fifth House, ruled by Leo and the Sun. Creativity, fruitful labor, and charisma get a boost from the collective power of these elements. The Sun urges us to express ourselves candidly, sharing our brilliance with others confidently. Leo takes passion to a higher level, giving us an unparalleled ability to attract others to our flames. This combo benefits artists of all mediums, and other professions may also get a beneficial bump of success and recognition. The generosity shown in this period has an exceptional power to do good, whether giving material resources or immaterial benefits like second chances.

This pairing rewards boldness but cautions against overreaching; egomania, workaholism, and pushiness must be curbed. 

FIRE & THE SUIT OF WANDS

Leo brings the element of Fire to Strength, tying this card to the Suit of Wands. Fire and Wands share a vigorous energy associated with intuition, craftsmanship, and grassroots political action. Our instinct to challenge ourselves to grow creatively or to break destructive patterns gets a boost from their cooperative energies. Unfortunately, sparks start wildfires when left unchecked. Watch out for ambition for its own sake, snark, and a certain impulsive selfishness.

Leo’s Fire is Fixed, the most mature and stabilizing modality, making our endeavors this year notable for their durability and trustworthiness. Fixed Fire’s shadow qualities relate to excessive inertia, bogging us down when we ought to adapt or compromise. 

HOUSES OF STRENGTH

This archetype connects with two astrological houses, one from the zodiac and one from its position in the Major Arcana. Strength's association with Leo links it to that sign's home in the Fifth House, and its card number brings us to the Eighth House. Think of them as our collective houses for the year. 

THE FIFTH HOUSE OF CREATIVITIES

Astrology gives us an expansive definition of creativity: art-making, child-rearing, sexual expression, aspects of public presentation like fashion, and our entertainment choices all belong to the Fifth House. Placements here stimulate our imaginations and playful instincts. The products might look very different (children versus coutoure), but all result from a drive to create new things and share them. Activities in the Fifth House often draw us into relationships, even one-sided ones like crushes or parasocial bonds with influencers, that impact our self-image. Keep an open mind and your Fifth House placements will tell you how to unlock your most joyfully chaotic inner wisdom.

This house invites us to do a comprehensive performance review of how well our creativity works for us:
Do our romantic relationships let us play with our sexuality and gender expression?
How well does our public persona mask our inner selves? Maybe too well, or have we crossed into TMI territory?
What does our labor contribute to, socially, and how do we feel about it? 
Who gets into our hearts and/or under our skin? What effects does their presence have on our psychic well-being?
We all do childcare, if only by our influence on the future: how are your parenting skills?

When unbalanced, the generally beneficial energies of this house quickly run amok. You meant to spend a little extra to launch a project, and now all your credit cards are maxed out. You got their digits last week and plan to move in together next month. Your passions burnt you out-- now you make nothing for no one. Beware the optimistic overload that the Fifth House puts on creative efforts by seeking council and sticking to a budget, especially an energy budget. 

THE EIGHTH HOUSE OF TRANSFORMATIONS

Two words dominate all discussions of the Eight House: sex and death! The grave and the orgasm both take us out of our individuated selves, grand dissolutions that lead to a period of regeneration. An obvious existential match despite their superficial differences, don't you agree? 

Besides literal deaths or erotic encounters, this house directs our attention toward the borders, thresholds, and liminal spaces in our lives. Financial transactions like paying taxes and receiving inheritances belong to this house because control or ownership shifts between entities. Negotiations, collective projects, and investments share this slippery quality and likewise belong to the Fifth House. So do therapeutic practices from psychiatry to massage and tantric sex— anything that intends to transform our bodies, minds, or partnerships. 

To work with the Eighth House, think like a mouse. Look along the edges of your life, scanning for places where outside energies squeeze into your thoughts and start to nibble at your peace of mind. Clarify points of exchange: job contracts, housework, affective labor, booty calls.

We find disordered attachments like stalking, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, or revenge fantasies in the basement of this house. Behaviors or thought patterns get stuck and grind inside our pyches. The tension builds, then releases with the catastrophic effects of an earthquake. Find constructive outlets to remedy these issues before you level a city.
