# PART III: ASTROLOGY

The stars do not map out our lives; they only show us the edges of our comfort zones. Astrology should put us in touch with our limits and motivate us to test them, joyfully and compassionately, as acts of cosmic self-love. We envision your life as a luminous jewel spinning in space, every facet a wonder to behold, and hope this work inspires you to go star-gazing with us.

## OUR APPROACH

As with tarot and ritual, many approaches to astrology exist and we again align ourselves with the mythopoetic and ecology-based schools of thought. Our use of natal charts and annual transits emphasizes potentialities over predictions, and we see the zodiac as another source of archetypal inspiration.

We don’t believe in “bad” astrological placements any more than we believe in bad cards. Everything observed in the cards or the sky shows us how to grow wiser and stronger even when they point out areas to improve. You may or may not like what you see in your chart; either way, you'll know where to focus your intentions in the coming year.

More technically, this guidebook uses Tropical (aka Western) astrology with Whole Sign Placements to calculate natal charts. We went with Whole Signs rather than the more common method, Placidus, because the charts look less intimidating. A simpler chart makes introducing the zodiac into your tarot practice more inviting, in our opinion, and other methods of determining houses do not conflict with our material as far as we see.

The most archaic roots of astrology remain buried and a teensy bit tangled in the archeological record, to put it mildly. Yet the research clearly shows that ancient astrologers connected the stars to the seasons and used their observations to advise their communities in the practical matters of life. They inhabited a living planet surrounded and sustained by awe-inspiring forces, not a resource-rich but ultimately insensate rock described in European thought.

Astrological storytelling was one of many tools they used to make choices in uncertain times shaped by incomprehensible forces, not unlike what we do today. They wanted people to feel less afraid, and more awe-struck, and we humbly place ourselves in this lineage.

## UNDERSTANDING PLACEMENTS

At the heart of every astrological interpretation lies the idea of *placement*: the confluence of a planet, a zodiac sign, and a house that creates a unit of meaning. When someone says "I'm a Scorpio Rising", they mean that the Sun was in the sign of Scorpio in the First House (the one "rising" on the horizon) at the moment of their birth. Folks generally use that pattern to talk about placements: *a planet in a sign in a house.*

Placements provide the basis for most of the ways we interpret charts and transits, the two categories of astrological readings. *Charts* describe the position of the sky at a moment in time, like a snapshot, whereas *transits* refer to movements (animated gifs) like a planet moving between houses.

Every decent natal chart will breakdown any aspects and patterns found in your sky, though we don't use them in this guidebook. An *aspect* (trine, conjunction, quincunx, etc.) refers to the angle between placements, and a *pattern* (e.g., Grand Trine, Yod) refers to collections of aspects that generate compound placements. Think of them as meta-aspects, or placements-of-placements.

### THE PLANETS

In astrology, a *planet* is any orbiting body including the Moon and several prominent asteroids. They represent instinctual urges and subconscious motivations, the essential energies that animate our lives. Venus corresponds to sexual and romantic desires, for instance, and so its placement in your natal chart hints at how you express yourself in affairs of the heart and, sometimes, the crotch.

Astrologers sort the planets into a few common subgroups:

* The Personal Planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
* The Impersonal Planets: Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto
* The Classical Planets: The Sun, Moon, and the Personal Planets
* The Asteroids: Juno, Ceres, Pallas, Eros, and most notably, Chiron.

We prefer to say Familial and Generational rather than Personal and Impersonal, but those names seem less commonly used. You may choose which subgroups to incorporate when analyzing your natal placements later in this section. We recommend leaving asteroids other than Chiron out of your initial readings until getting a clear view of the big picture.

#### THE SIGNS

The zodiac refers to the movement of the Sun through the sky over a year, divided into twelve portions called *signs*. Each sign conveys an aura or mood that colors how elements under it express themselves. Someone with Venus-in-Leo might flirt by sneaking a (consensual) pinch of your buttcheek, whereas someone with Venus-in-Virgo might empty the dishwasher as foreplay. (You'll understand when you're older.)

Signs of the zodiac follow a predetermined order that begins and ends at the equinox in March, with the sign of Aries, and change after approximately thirty days. This duration has nothing to do with lunar months although they often fit together nicely because of their similar cycle lengths (a lunar month lasts about 28 days).

A full moon happens in the sign opposing the season, e.g., Capricorn season has a full moon in Cancer.

#### THE HOUSES

The twelve sections of the sky that make the zodiac also form twelve *houses*, each linked to core areas of life experiences like families or careers. The planet and sign give us hints about what energies will come our way, and the house tells us where to expect them to land in our lives. Houses have fuzzy edges, however. Working out their boundaries for yourself works better than any dogmatic definition, and *The Twelve Houses Spread* has our take on them to get you started.

A house devoid of any planetary bodies does not foretell doom or deprivation in that area of your life. So-called *empty houses* signify that you face less struggle or drama in that area, but they do not say why. The same goes for *stellium* (houses crowded with four or more planets), which may signify anything from a party or a street brawl. Analyze the aspects and signs to get more information before picking out your shoes.

#### ELEMENTS & MODALITIES

Signs have associated alchemical elements: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. Every *element* relates to three of the twelve astrological signs, each in one of the three modalities (Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable). *Modalities* add nuance to how that element operates in that sign, not unlike how a sign influences the expression of a planet.

#### POLARITY

We do not add polarity to signs or houses because we have yet to find a binary that carries more meaning than baggage. We mention them because you will encounter many versions in other astrological sources: masculine-feminine, yin-yang, light-dark, active-passive, positive-negative, etc. Our exercises and spreads do not include them, but you could easily add them to your interpretation.

MODALITY - Fixed

### THE SUN & LEO

The image of the Lion on the Strength card links it to the Fifth House, ruled by Leo and the Sun. Creativity, fruitful labor, and charisma get a boost from the collective power of these elements. The Sun urges us to express ourselves candidly, sharing our brilliance with others confidently. Leo takes passion to a higher level, giving us an unparalleled ability to attract others to our flames. This combo benefits artists of all mediums, and other professions may also get a beneficial bump of success and recognition. The generosity shown in this period has an exceptional power to do good, whether giving material resources or immaterial benefits like second chances.

This pairing rewards boldness but cautions against overreaching; egomania, workaholism, and pushiness must be curbed. All matters of the Eighth House merit consideration during this period, and they do get tricksy! This house relates to transformations, gray areas, and energetic exchanges, which can be tough to navigate. On the other hand, it makes this year a fantastic time to shake up any patterns you’re tired of reliving.

### STRENGTH IN THE HOUSES

This archetype connects with two astrological houses, one from the zodiac and one from its position in the Major Arcana. Strength's association with Leo links it to that sign's home in the Fifth House, and its card number brings us to the Eighth House. Think of them as our collective houses for the year.

#### THE FIFTH HOUSE OF CREATIVITIES

Astrology gives us an expansive definition of creativity: art-making, child-rearing, sexual expression, aspects of public presentation like fashion, and our entertainment choices all belong to the Fifth House. An instinct for playfulness and imagination drives us to make new things and share them, regardless of how we might categorize the resulting products. These activities draw us into relationships, even one-sided or conceptual ones like parasocial bonds with influencers,  that inform or perhaps deform our self-image. Keep an open mind this year and your Fifth House placements tell you how to unlock your most joyfully chaotic inner wisdom.

This house invites us to do a comprehensive performance review of how well our creativity works for us:

* Do our romantic relationships let us play with our sexuality and gender expression?
* How well does our public persona mask our inner selves? Maybe too well, or have we crossed into TMI territory?
* What does our labor contribute to, socially, and how do we feel about it?
* Who gets into our hearts and/or under our skin? What effects does their presence have on our psychic well-being?
* We all do childcare, if only by our influence on the future: how are your parenting skills?

When unbalanced, the generally beneficial energies of this house quickly run amok. You meant to spend a little extra to launch a project, and now all your credit cards are maxed out. You got their digits only last week and now you're moving in together. Your passions burn you out, and now you make nothing for no one. Beware the optimistic overload that the Fifth House puts on creative efforts by seeking council and sticking to a budget.

#### THE EIGHTH HOUSE OF TRANSFORMATIONS

Two words dominate all discussions of the Eight House: sex and death! The grave and the orgasm seem like opposing energies, yet they both take us out of our individuated selves to unite us with the unknown. Each entails a grand dissolution that leads to a period of regeneration, and the good ones make us weep! An obvious existential match.

Besides literal deaths or erotic encounters, this house directs our attention toward the borders, thresholds, and liminal spaces in our lives. Financial transactions like paying taxes and receiving inheritances belong to this house because they shift control or ownership of resources between entities, transforming how it operates. Negotiations, collective projects, and investments share this slippery quality and likewise belong to the Fifth House. Therapeutic practices from psychiatry to massage and tantric sex belong here as well-- anything that intends to transform our bodies, minds, or partnerships.

To work with the Eighth House, think like a mouse. Look along the edges of your life, scanning for places where outside energies squeeze into your thoughts and start to nibble at your peace of mind. Clarify points of exchange: job contracts, housework, affective labor, booty calls.

We find disordered attachments like stalking, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, engulfing rage, or revenge fantasies in the basement of this house. Behaviors or thought patterns that ought to evolve naturally stick and reverberate, shaking us apart like an earthquake. Find constructive ways to remedy these issues.

### FIRE & THE SUIT OF WANDS

Leo brings the element of Fire to Strength, tying this card to the Suit of Wands. Fire and Wands share a vigorous energy associated with intuition, craftsmanship, and grassroots political action. Our instinct to challenge ourselves to grow creatively or to break destructive patterns gets a boost from their cooperative energies. Unfortunately, sparks start wildfires when left unchecked. Watch out for ambition for its own sake, snark, and a certain impulsive selfishness.

Leo’s Fire is Fixed, the most mature and stabilizing modality. It beats out a steady rhythm for Strength to play over, making our endeavors this year notable for their durability and trustworthiness. Fixed Fire’s shadow qualities relate to excessive inertia, making us slow to evolve or compromise when needed.
