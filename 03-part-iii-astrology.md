# PART III: ASTROLOGY

## TRANSITION TO PUT AT THE END OF THE PREVIOUS SECTION

Good idea on how to connect with the archetype, we can personalize how we work with Strength by adding astrology. Make sure you have your natal chart handy.

## THE REAL BEGINNING

The stars do not map out our lives; they only show us the edges of our comfort zones. Astrology should put us in touch with our limits and motivate us to test them, joyfully and compassionately, as acts of cosmic self-love. We envision your life as a luminous jewel spinning in space, every facet a wonder to behold, and hope this work inspires you to go star-gazing with us.

### OUR APPROACH

* there are many approaches
* we are Tropical and Western
* we use Whole Sign Placements
* we have an ecological approach that emphasizes potentialities over predictions
* see some resources & references

We don’t believe in “bad” astrological placements any more than we believe in bad cards. Everything we observe in the cards or the sky shows us how to grow wiser and stronger even when they point out areas to improve. You may or may not like what you see in your chart; either way, you'll know where to focus your intentions in the coming year. It's a chance to evaluate your strengths and grow even stronger.

#### THE SIGNS

* they have a system, starts in March, reflecs seasons not constellations per se
* why do signs matter, in the sense of how do they add meaning

#### THE HOUSES

* what are they? sections of the sky
* why do houses matter, in the sense of how do they add meaning

A house devoid of any planetary bodies does not foretell doom or deprivation in that area of your life. So-called "empty houses" signify that you have less struggle or drama in that area, which means those topics will not provide you the most motivation for growth. An empty house does not guarantee that you will never face difficulty, of course, only that your thorniest challenges lie elsewhere in the chart.

#### THE PLANETS

* why do planets matter

#### ELEMENTS & MODALITIES

* why do elements and modalities matter

#### POLARITY

* what are they
* why don't you use polarities (generally not into binaries, not finding them useful)

## CORRESPONDENCES OF THE ARCHETYPE

SIGN - Leo

PLANET - The Sun

ELEMENT - Fire

DATES - Jul. 23 to Aug. 22

HOUSE - V

MODALITY - Fixed

### THE SUN & LEO

As the eighth card in the Major Arcana, the Strength card aligns with the Eighth House and is ruled by Leo and the Sun. (The RWCS creators moved this card from its prior position as the eleventh card for this reason.) Creativity, fruitful labor, and charisma get a boost from the collective power of these elements. The Sun urges us to express ourselves candidly, sharing our brilliance with others confidently. Leo takes passion to a higher level, giving us an unparalleled ability to attract others to our flames. This combo benefits artists of all mediums, and other professions may also get a beneficial bump of success and recognition. The generosity shown in this period has an exceptional power to do good, whether giving material resources or immaterial benefits like second chances.

This pairing rewards boldness but cautions against overreaching; egomania, workaholism, and pushiness must be curbed. All matters of the Eighth House merit consideration during this period, and they do get tricksy! This house relates to transformations, gray areas, and energetic exchanges, which can be tough to navigate. On the other hand, it makes this year a fantastic time to shake up any patterns you’re tired of reliving.

### HOUSES OF STRENGTH

* you might work with both, or reading about them, you'll have an instinctive reaction to one that's important to you right now

#### THE FIFTH HOUSE OF EXPRESSION

* Leo's natural house is the fifth house, house of Expression (currently, I call it the
house of creativities but that's not quite right)
* meaning
* areas of life covered

#### THE EIGHTH HOUSE OF TRANSFORMATIONS

* we include the eighth house is associated with the Strength archetype due to its placement in the Major Arcana
* meaning
* areas of life covered

### FIRE & THE SUIT OF WANDS

Leo brings the element of Fire to Strength, tying this card to the Suit of Wands. Fire and Wands share a vigorous energy associated with intuition, craftsmanship, and grassroots political action. Our instinct to challenge ourselves to grow creatively or to break destructive patterns gets a boost from their cooperative energies. Unfortunately, sparks start wildfires when left unchecked. Watch out for ambition for its own sake, snark, and a certain impulsive selfishness.

Three of the twelve astrological signs have the element of Fire, each in one of the three modalities (Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable). Modalities add nuance to how that element operates in that sign. Leo’s Fire is Fixed, meaning the most mature and stabilizing expression of its influence. It beats out a steady rhythm for Strength to play over, making this year's endeavors notable for their durability and trustworthiness. Fixed Fire’s shadow qualities relate to excessive inertia, making us slow to evolve or compromise when needed.

## STRENGTH IN YOUR NATAL SKY

Incorporating astrology is an easy and effective way to personalize how you work with aspects of Strength. You’ll need your natal chart, which many online sources will calculate for free (see Resources and References). 

Once you have it, note the signs and planets for: 

1. the house ruled by Leo
2. the house hosting your Sun
3. your Fifth house
4. your Eighth house

INSERT TABLE:
HOUSE - SIGN - ELEMENT - MODALITY - PLANETS

* Fill out those four placements, like:
  * blank - LEO - FIRE - FIXED - blank
  * blank - blank - blank - blank - The Sun (with space for others)
  * FIFTH - blank - blank - blank - blank
  * EIGHTH - blank - blank - blank - blank

Each of these houses relates to the themes, struggles, and opportunities of an area of your life. Unfortunately, we can’t go into each possible placement in this guide (cough, newsletter) so you’ll have to look them up yourself or find an experienced astrologer. When you get a sense of the house meanings, take inventory of those aspects of your life both externally (as they manifest to others) or internally (as beliefs, shadows, or self-talk patterns). Feel out how the house, its ruling astrological sign, and any planetary bodies influence one another, intuitively.
