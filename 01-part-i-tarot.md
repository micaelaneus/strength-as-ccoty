# PART I: Tarot

First and foremost, the Strength card encourages us to draw on courage and compassion to navigate challenges with conviction. This card encourages us to confront our fears, embrace challenges, and cultivate resilience on the journey toward self-discovery. As our Collective Card of the Year, it promises a period of tremendous growth and expansive possibilities that flourish even amidst obstacles.

The Major Arcana lays out a sequence of metaphorical rites of passage that begin with a novice (Key 0 - The Fool) setting out on the road and end when they attain mystical integration with the cosmos (Key 21 - The World). Strength comes in the first half of this journey in which we acquire psychological tools to navigate society and achieve self-actualization in the second half.

Strength teaches us how to balance the raw power of our will as developed in the Seventh Key (The Chariot) with a more mature understanding of what strength means: resilience, emotional self-regulation, and the ability to meet others where they are. Cultivating these "soft skills" in the Eighth Key prepares us to pass The Hermit’s more esoteric tests in the Ninth.

We cover the astrological correspondences in greater detail in **Part III: Astrology.** Plants, minerals, and other associations with Strength are found in **Part II: Ritual.** For now, let's look at the symbols found on the tarot card itself and explore their meaning.

## SYMBOLS OF THE ARCHETYPE

In an open field, we see a Figure holding the mouth of a Lion with a full mane and lolling tongue. The Lion has claws yet looks subdued and its tail tucks between its legs. The Figure wears a simple white robe like those worn by initiates or romanticized peasants. Garlands of blooming flowers that might be roses wrap around their waist, and they wear a crown of meadow grasses or spring wheat. The only jewelry or ornament we see is the lemniscate that floats above the Figure’s head. In the distance, a forest lies at the base of a mountain range. The sky is cloudless.

Roman numerals for eight appear at the top-center and a box separates the card’s title, Strength, from the imagery. The artist, Pamela Coleman Smith, put her stylized initials at the bottom-right of her illustration.

### THE LION’S JAWS

The card’s central image shows a Figure grasping the open jaws of a Lion. Many say this act symbolizes taming or mastering one's instinctual nature, which implies that our basic desires are destructive. We agree that the Lion represents an element of primal energy inherent in embodiment, but one to integrate, not tame. The relationship between the Figure and the Lion seems filled with mutual trust, affection, and even playfulness. Holding the Lion's jaws is an act of collaboration between instinct and discernment, two key abilities of an evolved mind. The jaws themselves represent that liminal edge between trust and risk that we call *vulnerability.*

### FLOWERS & WREATHS

The vibrant foliage adorning the Figure’s waist and crown exudes joy and boldly shouts *huzzah for Life!* In a socio-economic system built on constraints, flourishing takes Strength. Think of the audacity shown by wildflowers growing along a highway median, pushing up through the asphalt meant to destroy them. Or picture the vivid genitalia-like splendor of the orchid. No shame, baby. Do you have the courage of a dandelion?

### THE LEMNISCATE AKA INFINITY SYMBOL

This well-known icon floating above the Figure’s head connects them to the ethereal, offering a point of balance to the otherwise lusty fleshiness of this card. A lemniscate loops over and around itself, an endlessly active energy yet one that stays in harmony with the greater universe. Its presence here reminds us that although Strength primarily relates to our personal power, we must stay in alignment with the eternal to fully realize the lessons of this key.

### THE WHITE ROBE

White robes symbolize purity, spiritual clarity, and the alignment of one's actions with higher principles. Traditionally, we wear all white as initiates, as (don’t laugh) virginal brides, and finally as shrouds. Seeing the Figure wear this simple robe rather than armor or an aristocratic fabric like silk tells us we’re not dealing with those forms of power. This Strength enters humbly, a perpetual novice preparing for their next rite of passage. Notice that the Figure gazes calmly and directly into the Lion’s eyes, not outward into ours as in most cards in the first half of the Major Arcana. We take this to mean that Strength has the discipline to stay in their lane, keep their eyes on their own paper, and never read the comments.

## INTERPRETATION

Look first at the peaceful expression on The Figure’s face. It tells us that the robust resilience we seek does not come through domination and control. Instead, we find strength through self-acceptance and equanimity. Celebrating our power helps us overcome our fears, a major theme of this card. We develop a healthy sense of ego by first meeting life’s challenges and then taking a moment to appreciate our newfound abilities. Reflect on a time you’ve been a bit bolder than you thought possible. Luxuriate in the feeling, regardless of the outcome. Savor yourself with the same shameless delight of a cat licking itself.

An aura of gentleness surrounds the pair shown on the card. The Figure and the Lion look relaxed because they feel safely held within a relationship built on mutual respect. Where an archetype like The Magician marshals tools and declares their will, Strength gets things done through exercising soft power: deep listening, skillful negotiation, and reciprocity. These skills only seem like magic. In truth, they are strategies we can learn to make facing and resolving disagreements more manageable. Find good teachers.

On a related note, this card might indicate that a relationship has undergone a rupture that now requires repairing. Strength says we can make amends without denying the original harm or letting it continue unchecked. Revisit harms done to or by you with fresh eyes, and look for opportunities to restore balance. You may never hear the apology you deserve or make one you long to deliver, yet you must find a way to move forward.

Not that it will be the walk in the park, never mind the meadow shown on the card. To take responsibility for how our most damaging impulses color every aspect of our lives, we first must acknowledge their existence. Yikes! Accountability always takes moral courage; owning our vulnerabilities in a society built on exploitation requires real guts. Holding others accountable is equally difficult, especially when we love them or when the behavior stems from addiction or mental health issues. Whichever side of the proverbial street you stand on, clean it up!

Self-expression is tricky in a world built on oppression. We suppress aspects of ourselves because we learned, correctly or not, that expressing them leads to pain and danger. Strength asks us to reclaim the energy spent on repression to conquer shame and search for communities that celebrate our sparkle. Where does authenticity feel sticky to you? Resist the urge to start yet another self-improvement project or rush to solve this problem via external means. Allow yourself a moment to feel the spaciousness and grace that comes when we frankly acknowledge a long-suppressed truth.

Finally, notice that the Figure approaches this ferocious creature fearlessly. They have befriended their inner Lion, integrating its seemingly frightening qualities into their conscious self. This card reminds us that we too have a place inside us beyond the reach of shame or self-deception, and great power waits to meet us there when we're ready. Strength holding the Lion's jaws represents someone who has made this journey and has returned transformed.

## SHADOW ASPECTS

Or does the Figure grip the Lion’s jaws as a show of superiority and domination?

In the real world, people “train” large cats by controlling access to food, mixing affection with intimidation, and inflicting pain. Violence and head games entrench abuse into the cats' psyches, instilling a condition of learned helplessness. Honestly, we cheer a little when we hear about one of these cats mauling their captor-trainers.

We see this as an apt metaphor for the dangerous fixation on control in Strength's shadow. Asserting dominance may feel amazing at the moment, but the lack of empathy ultimately limits growth for all parties involved. We can use this card to examine several ways this pattern plays out in our relationships.

First, a desire to demonstrate strength might lead to a mindset of overcoming challenges at any cost. A deadly dog-eat-dog worldview allows us to justify all manner of (self-) destructive behaviors. Next thing you know, this flowery Figure morphs into a latte-guzzling, over-scheduled girlboss who scares the crap out of poor Lion. (Look at the tail between its legs!) This attitude could result in neglecting your well-being or that of others to pursue external validation. Consider how ideologies like scarcity thinking, hustle culture, or hyper-individualism negatively influence the subject of your reading.

Alternatively, we might put on a facade of strength to appear composed and resilient on the outside while struggling internally. This emotional armor causes difficulty in seeking support when needed and may manifest as toxic positivity. This card tells us that not only do we need help, we deserve it. Perhaps you must give or receive a form of support that makes you somehow uncomfortable.

We often confuse self-criticism with self-discipline. Beating yourself up works at times, else we wouldn’t do it, right? But the costs to our self-esteem and peace of mind can be staggering. Strength suggests that it’s time for a new strategy. Try incorporating self-compassion into your approach to a challenge and trust that self-discipline can emerge from self-acceptance.

Love never seeks to control. All forms of domination or deception crush the spirit of awe and reverence that love requires. Yet the fear of losing love can make us feel the need to exert control in subtle ways. For example, we might hide parts of ourselves or start fibbing to manipulate how others perceive us. If we suspect our partners have begun to grow away from us, we pressure them similarly. Some relationships go on like this for decades— will yours?

Perhaps you notice another theme connecting Strength’s shadows: the capacity to endure what ought not to be endured. On an individual level, we experience this shadow when we suppress our feelings rather than deal with conflict openly. Misalignment causes profound distress, and still, we prefer to suffer than deal with the discomfort of acknowledging the issue. We gaslight ourselves, do extra physical or affective labor, or make excuses for a toxic person— anything and everything to protect ourselves from having to make hard choices based on facts. Eventually, the situation explodes, fizzles out, or becomes our new normal. If you’re caught in this trap, Strength’s appearance means you need to get real about the situation before you're forced to gnaw off a leg.

On a collective level, these shadows manifest as political inertia. We vote for “the lesser of two evils” when we ought to organize ourselves to build a more just and beautiful world. We spin our wheels on social media rather than show up in real life or do any number of other behaviors that disconnect us from our collective power. Problems with accountability, consent, and cultural appropriation fall into this same category.

In its darkest, most hateful manifestation, this card signifies fascism. The word fascism comes from the Italian fascia, meaning a bundle of sticks bound together. The image represents the idea of strength in numbers: a bundle can resist a force that would break a solitary stick. It could have been a beautiful metaphor but jabronies took it all the way to crap town. Resisting the global reemergence of fascism is perhaps the most critical collective action we will take this year.

## IN READINGS

Tarot practitioners commonly read the Strength card as an amplifier. Its presence emphasizes the influence of that placement and possibly the surrounding cards. When drawn as the signifier (often the first card of a spread) it suggests that the focus of the reading has profound meaning or potential power for the subject.

Watch too for the appearance of Wands, particularly the Queen of Wands. A fiery spread might indicate an extra charge (i.e., higher intensity or greater urgency) to the focus of the reading, especially one on creativity.

Previous incarnations of the Tarot called this card *Force.* That word carries a more concentrated energy, implying a strong and tightly directed use of willpower. See if that interpretation fits better in that placement.

Lastly, this sunny archetype moonlights as a curse-breaker. Destructive interpersonal dynamics, ruts that feel impossible to escape, and all sorts of compulsive behaviors can be changed when Strength appears in a relevant placement.
