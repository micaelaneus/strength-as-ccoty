# PART V: Open Circle Work

All strength is collective strength. Microbiota co-create our bodies, and it takes co-regulation to keep them going. Our species gravitates into groups, whether sitting around a fire or on folding chairs like at a meeting, and solitary confinement is torture. The work of radical witches begins with casting a circle but it doesn’t stop when we close it because the magic we summon is meant to change the world. That takes practical effort— strategy, solidarity, sweat– and we expect to see y’all in the streets this year! Until then, here are other ideas for making magic.

## EMBRACE EMBODIMENT

As both word and archetype, Strength quite naturally evokes the body as a source of power and beauty. What bliss! But in keeping with our shadow theme (“capitalism ruins everything”), this same card brings up all manner of goopy anti-body ideologies like ableism and fatphobia. These ideas only pretend to want the best for the body; in fact, they never cease to invent new ways for us to dissociate, disparage, and destroy ourselves.

Instead, we can make this year about reclaiming our wrinkly-rolly selves by uplifting the awesome aspects of Strength and consciously wrestling with its shadows. First, pick a loving practice to root yourself into flesh like stretching before bed or using your fist to practice french-kissing. Lift weights without making it a referendum on your self-worth or gender identity, and vow to touch more trees. Start the revolution in one sentence: I Never Criticize My Body.

Next, deal with the shadows by learning about ableism, body inclusivity, and the Three Furies of Disembodiment: Beauty, Diet, and Wellness Cultures. Because these ideas affect every one of us (though some more directly than others), changing them is a collective responsibility. Identify how they inform (and deform!) your life and worldview, then find ways to alter course.

## GATHER COUNCIL

At some point every day, preferably in the morning, recite the name of every non-human creature you know in a 20-mile radius, whether animal, plant, fungal, geological, microbial, etc. Stellar jay, coyote, lodgepole pine, Yuba River, hummingbird moth, manzanita, granite… locate yourself in the ecological community and marvel at your place in an incomprehensibly vast web of relationships. Gather these neighbors into a council and turn to them when it’s time to make decisions. What does it look like to take a crow’s advice?

Writer Sophie Strand created this simple but powerful ritual and shared it publicly. We put a link to one of her pieces about this practice in Resources & References.

## FORM AN AFFINITY GROUP

We all see the threats waiting in the coming year, and we must prepare to meet them collectively. An affinity group refers to two to five people who organize themselves based on shared desire and ability to participate in political action. They let us attend large protests more safely and still do smaller direct actions independently, according to the interests and schedules of its members. It's as sacred as any coven, even when you're the only member who practices radical witchcraft. 

Invite a few like-minded friends to get together now, while things remain relatively calm, to prepare for more tumultuous moments. Share the expenses of making banners or assembling first-aid kits, and make them together as part of a potluck. Create a transportation plan and a fund for gas money if you expect to travel for protests. Find out which causes matter most to folks and how they want to demonstrate their support when those causes get attacked. 

Plan to check in with one another during an action, and decide how and when the group will leave one. Talk about disability, arrest-ability, meds, childcare, and other critical parts of life that need consideration, and then get ice cream and go roller-skating! We are forming affinity groups for collective power, not doom squads. Militant joy FTW!

Never, ever pressure anyone to join or agree to an action. Commitment is key, and that requires authenticity and consent. 

## RE-ENCHANT YOUR LIFE

In the past, people worked with beautiful tools built to honor and inspire those who used them. Industrial capitalism took that away, robbing daily life of some of its splendor. Take it back by re-framing the mundane or sanctifying your tools.

* Write your to-do list poetically. Don’t go to the dentist— get your seashells polished.
* Turn your morning mug into a sacred vessel. Fill it with stone and plant allies that attract the power you want to infuse into your life and leave it under a full moon.
* Enchant your commute by attaching mantras or intentions to places you pass, or divining personal omens. Crossing that bridge or overpass brings you into a new realm, and a hawk on that telephone poll means you should make love as soon as possible.
* Sanctify one of the super fat Sharpies and a bag of random stickers as magic wands and sigils, then keep them handy so you can cover up fascist graffiti in public restrooms.
* Get some cuter pajamas and tell everyone about your new spacesuit.
