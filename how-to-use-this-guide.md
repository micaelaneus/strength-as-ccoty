# WELCOME

Welcome to our Strength year! We made this guide to serve your growth and well-being, as well as support your involvement in collective struggle. 

* explain collective card idea
* majors as narrative arc
* keys as a conceptual framework for our approach to tarot

## HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

* arc of the guidebook

Inside, you’ll find three detailed spreads based on mythopoetic tarot with an explanation of how to blend basic astrology into your readings. We’ve given you several themes you might want to explore in spell work alongside one full ritual to transition from a year of The Chariot (2023) into the incoming Strength year. In the final sections, you’ll find some ideas on how to extend this collective work by incorporating your individual Card of the Year (COTY) and working in the open circle (more on that below).

You need only three essential tools to use this guide: a journal, a tarot deck, and your astrological natal chart.

### YOUR TAROT DECK

This guide uses the classic deck illustrated by Pamela Coleman Smith that comes with the “little white book” of interpretations written by Arthur Edward Waite, originally published in 1909 by Rider & Son of London. You will hear it called by some combination of those names: the Rider-Waite, the Waite-Smith, or even the Rider-Waite-Coleman-Smith deck are all common variants. We refer to it as the RWCS deck to cover all these cases. Whatever you call it, it is the most recognizable version of the tarot.

Many modern tarot artists have adapted the ideas and storylines of the RWCS deck to suit (sorry) their needs, and we list a selection in Resources and References. The Wikipedia entry for the deck has an image of each card as designed in 1909 for folks who don’t own one yet.

### YOUR NATAL CHART

It's not necessary to understand every aspect of your natal chart or much about astrology generally to start. This guide walks you through the essentials, and the rest is easily found online.

### YOUR JOURNAL

good idea to start a tarot journal specifically.

* keep many journals, why not??
* many uses:
  * see trends in your spreads
  * do a reading at the start of a project or relationship, use for reflection later in the process
  * build up an interpretitive body
  * cool to see how far you come
  * remember cool spreads
* advice:
  * don't be precious-- treat like a school notebook, not an art project
  * date everything!
  * add notes about your sources-- for instance: (give example). You will absolutely forget and want to go back to something only to realize you have no idea where you read/saw/heard something

## WORKING IN THE OPEN CIRCLE

* just explain casting a circle

If you’ve opened a circle with others, then you have likely encountered a version of a classic closing phrase: the circle is open yet unbroken. It means that although our time in a ritual space necessarily ends and we return to “normal life”, we remain connected in a larger universal circle that encompasses all beings. How we act toward and speak to one another and our moral obligations to the more-than-human world stay within this sacred space.

Witchcraft turns radical when we embrace this open-circle work as an integral part of our practice, as vital as the more esoteric elements like tarot or spellcraft. Radical witches seek to re-root our identities and cultures into ecological reality, long denied by mainstream Western philosophy. Our work must always advance a liberatory vision of interconnection between all beings to counteract the authoritarian and hierarchical paradigm that is destroying the world. This paradigm has wounded each of us individually, both warping our relationships with others with internalized -isms and instilling all sorts of shame and self-betrayal into our psyches. Radical witchcraft is one way of healing and transforming this damage.

Open-circle work means:

* all forms of collective organizing
* going to therapy or support groups
* unlearning oppressive behaviors like white supremacy
* decolonizing through land remediation and rematriation
* exploring gender and sexuality beyond the binary
* naming abusers and supporting survivors
* abandoning punishment as a supposed source of safety
* staying loyal to joy in times of deep discomfort

We consider the open circle a non-negotiable aspect of our magic and you’ll see that phrase throughout this guide.

## WORK WITH US THROUGHOUT THE YEAR

We begin publishing seasonal guides for working with Strength as our collective card of the year in March when Aries kicks off the new astrological year. Each guide offers tarot, astrology, and ritual inspiration in keeping with that season’s astrological sign. Our work belongs to the emerging discipline of radical witchcraft, though you might hear other names for the mix of paganism and anti-authoritarian politics we practice.

## A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO READING TAROT

It takes about three minutes to master the basics of reading the cards: form a question in your mind, pull a card, and then interpret its meaning. Of course, you’ll get more from tarot by taking each of those steps seriously. Let’s go through them.

### SET THE SCENE

First, you don’t need a tricked-out altar to read tarot. We adore the aesthetics as much as the next witch, but the magic comes from centering yourself. If incense and candles get you there, go for it! But never believe that your intuitive practices require them.

* spreads: why or why not
* ritual openers: basic or fancy

### FORM A QUERY

Whether or not you use a pre-defined spread, you need a well-articulated theme or query related to developing your potential and directing your power. Frame your query like you’re asking advice from a trusted friend, not a favor from a rich one. Only one witch got to the ball in a pumpkin that we know of; the rest of us have to hoof it.
  
A useful question sticks to a timeframe where you have the power to act, meaning either the present or near future in most cases. Asking “Will I be a famous author?” before you so much as sharpen a pencil won’t yield useful information. Too much work lies between you and the goal. Try, “What can I put energy into that would help me improve as a writer?”

Lastly, don’t try to use tarot to read minds– it’s not healthy, and it won’t work anyway.

### PULL A CARD

* array of beliefs about handling the cards, shuffling styles, cutting the deck, letting others touch the deck, etc. You'll have to feel it out. 
* our beliefs:
  * we shuffle anyway we feel like it, including the bridge method
  * we don't share the decks we use for readings bc it feels like letting other people touch our phones or use our toothbrushes even with lovers-- logically, maybe it's fine?? But it makes us ick.
  * but we have decks that we mostly have because we love the artwork, we let others handle those
  * we like using our left hand to cut and pull decks
* when we use tarot as part of a journal practice, we have some extra steps:
  * read the prompt and journal our first thoughts
  * turn the card over and make notes of our intepretation, including looking the card up in potentially several resources-- the inspiration is out there and we go hunting for it like a pig after truffles
  * add to our journal entries
  * why? we use tarot to extend the range of our intuition and shake up our assumptions, not deliver unassailable truths from the void. We're co-creating the interpretation with the cards, the body of literature on the archetype, and our own intellects. Adding a step of concious reflection (pre-journaling) helps us achieve that goal

### INTERPRET A CARD

Interpreting the cards skillfully takes blending the vast array of traditional meanings with your intuition at the moment you pull a card. Everyone refers to the writing of other tarot practitioners, even “experts” because we all find inspiration in the diversity of thought. Never apologize for looking up a card! At the same time, we encourage you to trust your intuition. Pay attention to your immediate impression and associations, jot them down in your journal, and then look up what others have to say.

* add these notes to your tarot journal

#### OUR STYLE OF READING TAROT
 
* we use gender-neutral language even for gendered cards like The High Priestess. You do you. Find non-binary decks in Resources and References.
* we have a mythopoetic approach - potentiality over prediction

#### HARD CARDS
You will inevitably pull cards with disturbing imagery and intimidating descriptions that many folks call “hard cards.” We firmly believe (and have personally experienced) that every card offers wise counsel in its way. Think of cards that upset you as bitter medicine: truths that hurt to swallow yet still may heal you. Also remember that a strong reading draws our attention to the path we’re walking, but it doesn’t control our steps. A card or spread that bothers you means that it’s time to find a fork in the road, not lay down in the middle of it.
