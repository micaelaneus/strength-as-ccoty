# TAROT: The Lemniscate Spread

What comes first, the snowflake or the sea? The question has no answer because the water cycle has no distinct beginning or end; water gradually changes form as it flows from one environment to the next. The lemniscate (aka infinity symbol) represents those parts of life that ebb and expand subtly, which makes this spread helpful when you feel an energetic shift rather than an abrupt change. We share it here to guide an inquiry into an evolving aspect of your life during the transition from The Chariot into Strength.

## READING THE SPREAD

If your practice contains a ritual opener such as casting a circle or calling in guides, perform it now. Take a moment to settle into your body. Articulate your query mentally or in writing to strengthen and focus your intention. When you feel ready, shuffle and cut the cards. Place them one by one facing up, or place them all face down and move through the spread by turning them over. Whichever you choose, follow the curves of the lemniscate.

CARD 1 - YOU AT THE POINT OF DEPARTURE: Insight into where you stand at the end of a cycle

CARD 2 - OUTSIDE INFLUENCE: An energy, focus, or external factor with declining significance
