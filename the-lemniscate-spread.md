# TAROT: The Lemniscate Spread

The lemniscate, or infinity symbol, represents those parts of life that ebb and expand subtly, where one energy fades as a new one gains strength, in an eternal cycle of renewal. Its looping, liminal quality inspired us to make a spread that explores the waning influence of The Chariot in relation to the waxing Strength year. You can repurpose it to reflect on any transitional period in your life by swapping out the Receding and Rising themes.

## READING THE SPREAD

Take a moment to settle into your body and articulate your query, preferably in writing. If your practice contains a ritual opener such as casting a circle or calling in guides, perform it now. Shuffle and cut the cards, placing them along the curves of the lemniscate and intrepreting each one before pulling another.

### RECEDING ENERGY: THE CHARIOT YEAR

CARD 1 - DEPARTING: You at the end of the cycle

CARD 2 - WANING: An external energy or entity with declining significance

CARD 3 - SHRINKING: Emotional (shadow) preoccupation or belief to integrate and move on from

CARD 4 - CONCLUDING: An area or ability, perhaps a struggle, that nears completion

CARD 5 - OFFERING: Something to surrender as you cycle forward

### RISING ENERGY: THE STRENGTH YEAR

CARD 6 - ARRIVING: You at the start of a cycle

CARD 7 - WAXING: An external element with increasing significance

CARD 8 - SHIFTING: Emerging ideas or energies for self-reflection and shadow work

CARD 9 - CONCEIVING: Aspiration to point toward, or place to improve your awareness

CARD 10 - SPARKING: Something to accept, whether new energy or hard reality

### BINDING

These final cards bookend your reading with advice from the collective unconscious.

CARD 11 - A NOTE OF CAUTION: An aspect of the emerging phase to treat with care

CARD 12 - A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT: An opportunity or bit of inspo for the coming period
